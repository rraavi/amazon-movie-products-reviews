review/summary: Great Fun From Pixar
review/text: Another in a long line of excellent films from Pixar. Perhaps a bit formulaic, but well executed and great fun to watch. The voice talents are excellent, the CGI is beautiful, the story is entertaining and the pacing is good, too. Perhaps not quite up to "The Incredibles" or the "Toy Story" levels, but very good nonetheless.

review/summary: Cool Movie
review/text: I just bought a PlayStation 3 which has a built in bluray player, so I decided to get some bluray movies and this was one of them.  I'd never seen it before.  The movie was pretty good.  I liked the story line even though it's a pretty repeated theme.  The effects were pretty good.  The voices in the movie were excellent (even Owen Wilson...whom I don't normally like).  The bluray was pretty cool but I was getting the feeling like it was almost too pristine.  When I watch a movie, I expect some cracks and pops from the film (I don't like that but) and this one was perfect.  The cars all looked nice and shiny and the scenery was perfect.  But almost too perfect.  Good movie though.

review/text: I have been forced to watch this movie at least 20 times and I still enjoy everything about it.  The Computer animation is top notch, the soundtrack is great, and all the top of the line actors do a terrific job, with many memorable lines.  My 2 and 4 year old boys love it over and over again.  What's not to like.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: Out of the 30 or so HD movies I have seen this looks by far the best.  The backgrounds and details are so fine and really jump out in HD.  I am hoping that other Pixar movies like Finding Nemo look as good.  I am watching in full 1080p on a computer with a 24" widescrean LCD and 5.1 surround.  I am very picky about image quality and see few real actor movies getting very good images in HD.  About the only thing that comes close is nature and travel pictures in IMAX shows, but those are not as entertaining at Cars...  Yes I am 38 and still watch cartoons. :p  Update... even after going through over 100HD movies it is still one of the best.  It is a shame that Disney/Pixar does not release others like this to Blu-ray.  Monster Inc., Incredibles, and especially Finding Nemo would be great in HD.

review/summary: One More Great Movie From Disney/Pixar Partnership
review/text: This movie is pure enjoyment from second one to the closing credits. Talking about the finest animation usually provided by Disney/Pixar partnership is redundant. The plot is convincing (except for the talking cars) as it approaches the modern life in detriment of slow-paced and honest small town America.  The movie also approaches the value of having true friends around you and shows that helping others in their most difficult moments gives a sense of self-fulfillment and that no money or glory can ever replace.  Entertainment guaranteed or your money back. Truly a family flick.

review/summary: Cute, Funny, Heartwarming
review/text: I really enjoyed this movie, it was heartwarming.  I even cried (yeah I know I'm weak) but its very good!  I love how everybody in the little town has their own little shop and their personality but they all get along.  Okay well heres my summary:   Lightening McQueen is a rookie and doing great, him and 3 other cars tie a race.  So as a tie breaker they have another race in I think California.  So as Mac (McQueen's truck) is driving him to the race he falls asleep and McQueen goes out.  He ends up by himself and drives and he ends up in Radiator Springs where he makes friends and learns a huge secret!  And then watch the ending for yourself, I recommend it and trust me I'm alittle older so all age levels will love this movie!

review/text: We love Pixar animation in general, and are particularly fans of Cars. Our 3 year old son would watch it on a continuous loop if allowed.  The story is sweet and addresses loyalty, friendship (making and keeping), team work, and respect for the more experienced.  The music is great, there is as always funny adult things that make it entertaining.

review/summary: "The relentless quest for perfection" pays off again
review/text: Had not Lexus thought of it first, Pixar could've adopted the motto "the relentless quest for perfection" -- especially on this movie. From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.  I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; "humanizing" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.  After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, "I may never look at a car in the same way again!" I'm betting that your whole family will feel the same way.

review/summary: Trenton's Review
review/text: The Movie CARS I like the movie because it is funny and I like the fast cars, the pimped out cars I like are DJ, Boost, Snot rode, and Wingo. The funny cars I like are Mater because of all the stuff he says like when he is saying his name he says "my name is mater like Tamater but without the Ta". If Lightning would of got tires he would of won and would be the first ever rookie to win the Piston cup But when he's on the last turn he blows two tires. Then no one knows how won. And the King goes up to Lightning and said "he's a gutsy racer but you're stupid". Then the King says "get you a good crew chief and then you will be good". And then they say for the first time ever lightning says a rookie has won then he jumps through the paper. Then the announcer says there is a three way tie then on the way to California. DJ, WINGO, SNOT ROD, and BOOST started pushing Mac and Lightning falls out of the back of the truck. And he ends up in Radiator Springs. He was speeding and the Sheriff was going so fast Lightning thought that the Sheriff was shooting at him. So Lightning started going faster and when he got into the town he tour up the rode. So he had to fix the road with Beshy. And mater said "I would give two lug nuts to be with Beshy. Then he went really fast and the road was a lot worse so he had to do it again and that time he finished it. Then he found out that the judge was the Hudson Hornet. And then he tells Mater that he won 4 Piston cups and then Mater says "he did what in his cup". Lightning makes the Hudson Hornet mad so he calls somebody and tells him where Lightning is. So he was racing and was losing bad but then he hears all the people from Radiator Springs. And then he starts to win and Chick makes The King crash so lightning goes and helps The King cross the finish line. Then the Dinoco  manger over and asks Lightning if he wants anything and he says yes and Mater gets to ride in a helicopter and Radiator springs is put back on the map. Its one of my favorite shows and I think other people my like it to so watch it.

review/summary: Huge surprise worth the price
review/text: It was under protest that my family bought this DVD. Being used to menu options for multiple spoken and subtitled languages, we thought it ridiculous to have to buy BOTH the English -only- and Spanish -only- versions. It wasn't long into the movie when we saw the reason for the Spanish only version: on-screen Spanish writing! The written items critical to the plot were in Spanish (trophies, newspaper, leader board, etc). Now we wish other movies would do the same

review/summary: Great for the kids and a plot too!
review/text: Part of Lasseter's vision for Pixar is to make sure each and every movie he makes has a PLOT. And CARS does. Little Lightning McQueen (better known as "Stickers" by his love interest due to the sponsor ship logos all over him) is a hotshot race car who becomes lost and stuck in a small po-dunk town somewhere in the Southwest Desert (New Mexico? Arizona? Who knows...). He has to learn humility and what selflessness really is before he can get back on track (yeah, yeah pun intended).  The movie's cute. Yes, cute. I know I cringe when I hear my Creative Writing students use this word about someone's work. All of the hype of the year was worth it for this one, and I know I've not see Happy Feet or Haunted House, but it's Pixar AND Disney. How can it lose next month? Best Animated is usually a shoo-in, but I'll hold that card until after Happy Feet whose reviews definitely aren't as good. I even cried during Cars when the older race car is shoved off the track and wrecks. Oh my! An Oscar contender makes me a shed a tear. Good job, Lasseter.

review/summary: First look...not that great, but a second look...WOW, what a movie!
review/text: I have to admit when I first saw this movie and it came out I didn't get it.  I didn't like it either, for some reason it just didn't fit my tastes.  Yeah it was cute and everything, but it didn't grab my attention.  Maybe because I wasn't really interested in it at the time.  Once my first child became two years old, she was really into Cars (not per se the movie but the actual cars like Hot Wheels) and well I was looking for something for her to watch on a movie in the dvd player in the van.  I came across Cars the movie once again.  Boy did she love it!  This is the only movie that my daughter can watch about 3-4 times and beg for more of and I have grown to love this movie too.  The animation of this movie is outstanding, far surpasses a lot of what pixar has done and makes me feel like driving through Arizona sometime soon just to see it in person.  The storyline is funny and the characters are funning and loving.  The message that the movie sends is very heartwarming in which a car finds who he really is.  The music goes great with the movie and one thing that I really love about the movie is every time you watch it, you see something you didn't before.  Something that Pixar put that you didn't notice until you saw it a little bit closer.  For example, Sally hits Luigi when she is talking to Mcqueen, there are tire tracks in the sky when they are racing in the dirt, etc...it's neat to see how they put hidden stuff in there like that.  If you saw this movie once and didn't like it, I recommend to watch it again and see for yourself.  I love it now and sit down with my daughter when she watches it.  It's one of Pixars best and I wish they would make another one, but they don't like to do sequels.

review/text: The aspect I like most about "Cars" is that there is no villain (unless you count the nasty green race car, but he is such a small part of the movie, that he is easy to ignore) and almost NO crude or stupid humor (which is what I hate most about modern television).  All you have is a selfish young car that learns to love others and to value people and friendships.  He learns this from "normal" everyday cars that care about each other and come to care about him.  The show just makes you feel good about what you can do to be a good friend.  The ending just puts a great big exclamation point on the theme of the whole movie.  I loved it.  This is what movies should be like.  Oh and did I mention that it is FUNNY!

review/summary: THE WORST OF PIXAR, BEST OF ANYTHING ELSE
review/text: As much as I try to like this movie, I find very hard making any kind of connection with the car characters. I doubt too many people have ever looked at their vehicle as something with a life of its own, unlike with their toys (or even bugs for that matter). I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre. That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story. I just don't think it was that good a premise to begin with.

review/text: While perhaps not Pixar's greatest work, Cars is definitely more than watchable, and the blu-ray presentation is simply top-notch.  Like most CGI movies, the transfer is absolutely beautiful, no grain, no artifacts just beautiful.  Vibrant and crisp colors really show off your television and make this movie a joy to behold.  Combine that with great sound and some pretty neat special features that are sure to keep the kids entertained and you are looking at one of Disney's best efforts in my opinion despite it not being the best movie to come from Pixar.  Picture (5/5) Sound (5/5) Extras (5/5) Movie (3/5)

If you have a robust home theater with solid surround sound, then this is a great purchase.

review/summary: Now *THIS* is how high-definition should look!
review/text: When I first heard about Cars, I didn't think much of it. I always loved Pixar's movies but I couldn't really see what they were trying to accomplish with a movie where there wasn't a single humanoid to be found anywhere. Plus, I thought another "talking cars" property would be as stupid as all the other ones. I didn't see or read much about the movie in the months leading to its release in theaters and so didn't have a whole lot of reason to expect a lot from the movie, which I was going to see almost out of duty (both because my younger cousins were in town and because it was a Pixar film).  After the credits rolled, I knew I had just watched my second favorite Pixar film and one of my top 10 Disney films of all time. I still like Finding Nemo the best because it has a more emotional and universal moral component to it. I also happen to think that Ratatouille is a better "film" in general but I had a LOT more fun watching Cars. Like with Finding Nemo, I can watch this movie over and over again and not get tired of it. It may have to do with the inner child in me - my young nephew can't get enough of Cars and Finding Nemo but isn't nearly as impressed with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, two films my wife and friends like more.  I liken Cars to Shrek in the sense that there's always something interesting going on in the background if you care to look past the core of what's happening. The world in which Lightning McQueen and Mater live is cleverly designed to be almost exactly like ours would be if there all organic life forms were replaced with motorized vehicles. Even many parts of the landscape are shaped like vehicles in much the same way we sometimes think that a mountain or tree kind of looks like the side of someone's face. And many aspects of the world are dealt with in the clever manner we've come to expect from the geniuses at Pixar - insects are VW Beetles, Lighting McQueen's two biggest fans love to flash their headlights (quite literally, for those of you with your mind in the gutter) and the racing commentators are named Bob Cutlass and Darryl Cartrip.  While the general premise of the story is nothing new and fairly basic - a hot shot rookie race car concerned only with himself ends up in a long forgotten midwest town where the locals help him learn to enjoy life and care about something greater than oneself - the movie is immensely fun to watch, thanks mostly to the personality quirks of the citizens (specifically a run down tow truck with a good soul) of Radiator Springs, "the cutest little town in Carburetor County." It's always a joy to watch McQueen discover that there's more to life than fame and money.  If the movie being great wasn't enough, this particular Blu-Ray disc also boasts the hands-down best video quality I've seen in any high-definition disc. This is the first movie I've seen where I can say that if you haven't seen it in high-definition, you haven't seen it at all. CGI movies tend to have really impressive transfers because the studios can use masters stored digitally instead of on film, but Cars outshines all others... and it's not a photo finish by a long shot. There are tons of little details that I didn't even see when I saw it on the big screen a year and a half ago. One perfect example is Lightning McQueen's paint job. Before I watched the Blu-Ray disc last night (Christmas Day), I didn't know that there were all these little sparkles in the paint similar to the "jewel" or "pearl" type colors you see for new car models these days (if you've seen the red 2008 Saturn Outlook, you'll know what I mean). My jaw simply dropped when I noticed that because it was just a completel revelation to me, all thanks to Blu-Ray (and my television is just 1080i).  Another impressive thing about this disc is the "Car Finder" interactive movie game, a first of this kind on any home movie format. When you play this game, a special little heads-up graphical user interface comes on over the movie which shows your score, what cars to look for and how many you've missed so far. The premise of the game is that you basically keep an eye out for specific cars shown at the bottom of the screen. If you see one in any particular scene of the movie, you hit an action button on your remote control and a new car to look for pops up in its place. Even better, every car you find is added to a huge showcase gallery that has a close-up image of the car, the scene in which the car appeared and an audio background biography of the character (you can now find out what the actual name of the Apple-sponsored car in the opening Dinoco 400 race is). The only annoying aspect is that the normal controls for the movie (pause, stop, skip, etc.) are disabled - the only way to get out of the movie is to hit the "Pop-up Menu" button.  All in all, this is hands-down the best and most impressive high-definition release so far (this is coming from a staunch HD-DVD supporter). I cannot recommend this movie highly enough unless you either just didn't like this movie or aren't a fan of "kids'" movies in the first place. Otherwise, if you own a Blu-Ray player, do yourself a service and purchase Cars today... or even better, buy a Blu-Ray player to enjoy this movie in a whole new way!

review/text: Our copy of this DVD has been played more times than I can count since my kids got it for Christmas 2006. It's a fairly long movie with a lot of action, which is perfect for car trips to Grandma's house 100 miles away.  At first, I wasn't crazy about the voice of Lightning McQueen or even of Doc Hudson, but they've grown on me. And with Larry the Cable Guy as the voice of Mater, there are some screamingly funny parts to the movie. I didn't think the plot was that predictable, as others have written. The end was not what I expected, which was good.  If you watch this on a large enough screen, you'll find that even the insects are cars. They leave tiny little tire tracks on the windows when they crawl on them. Oh, and watch for the tire tracks that some of the airplanes leave in the desert sky...

Added to the fact that the story and the characters won me over, was the presentation of this Blu ray film on my HDTV. I have to agree that this film has to be one of the best looking films I have ever seen in HD. One of the other films that matches up to this quality is also made by Pixar.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: We have been watching this movie on demand lately.  When they finally took it off the list, we decided to buy it in blu-ray.  We were amazed at the quality difference between blu-ray and standard.  It sounds better, the colors are brighter and the images have so much more detail.  The closest to a 3D experience than I've had so far.  Highly recommended if you have the technology.

review/summary: Hi-Speed Hi-Def!
review/text: I have the DVD of this film and HAD to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  This movie was an instant Pixar classic from the moment the first bit was proceesed.  The CG animation is fantastic and the storyline will keep adults and children glued to their 103" plasmas (or 56" DLP in my case) from start to end. Action, adventure, emotion and kick a** hi-def... it's all packed into this must have Blu-Ray disc for you to enjoy, and to show off your high tech AV toys to your friends.  If you don't have it in HD, order it now.  You're welcome. :)

review/summary: Visually perfect...
review/text: I think it is not necessary to write something about the movie, if you love Pixar movies, this is no different. What makes this Blu Ray so special? The picture quality! I have never seen such a beautiful image on a Blu Ray. Full digital transfer from the master is the key for this. The details are just stunning. You can test this, if you own the DVD release. The Full HD picture adds so much more to the movie, you can see all the details on the cars, and the colors are so bright and vivid, like a perfect drawing. If you want to show what Blu Ray is really capable, look no further this is it, top notch all the way. I would give 6 out of 5 stars for the picture quality

review/summary: Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Animated Gem
review/text: Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, "Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is "yes," at least at the time I viewed this.  After watching "The Polar Express" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' "faces" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.   The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.  The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.  As a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger .

review/summary: pretty good cartoon
review/text: I kept putting off *Cars* because basically I don't care for NASCAR or any of that racing stuff.  However, when I saw *Cars* it wasn't so bad.  When Lightning McQueen ties with 2 other cars in a racing competition, they must re-race at another location in California.  Overnight, while sleeping in a semi-truck, McQueen is lost in the middle of nowhere.  Not only is he lost but he's in trouble for damaging a road strip and is sentenced to repair the road.  Trapped and angry about his potential loss of a championship and sponsorship, he soons learns that there's more to life than winning the cup.  He meets other cars and befriends them as well as getting interested with one of them.  Meanwhile, he discovers there's someone there that used to be a racer but has kept it a secret.  Regardless of his friendship with everyone, McQueen still has to repair the road.  When he is done, he has to decide which is more important...the race or his new friends.  Pixar still hasn't failed me.  Even though I'm not fond of car racing, *Cars* was still an entertaining watch.

review/text: Really enjoyed this movie, which I saw first in a theater. The Mario Andretti reference puzzled me because he is a very minor character in the film. However, I viewed the extras on the DVD and discovered that the makers got a lot of support from the racing community and took a tour of Route 66. (The desertion of Route 66 plays a big part in the story.) Highly recommended.

My only upset was that they put at least one bad word in it. I know kids hear cussing all the time now, but they don't need to hear it in cartoons. It just makes it more acceptable for them to repeat.

review/summary: Great quality product, Great quality movie
review/text: This movie is first-rate entertainment for kids--and adults, too! At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk "kid" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old "man" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended.

review/summary: One of Pixar's Best 'Vehicles' Yet....
review/text: Pixar has delivered a winner worthy of the checkered flag in 'CARS'.  This film marks the return of Pixar to what they do best:  a story about a character who learns what is really important in life (ie Toy Story 1 & 2, Monsters Inc. & Finding Nemo).  Coupled with the jaw-dropping, eye-popping, high quality CGI we've come to expect from the studio, Pixar adds a great soundtrack guarranteed to have the audience on their feet cheering Lightning on to victory.  'CARS' truly has something for everyone:  the kids will love the fast paced race scenes and 'Mater's jokes;  NASCAR fans will appreciate the voices and the attention to the details of racing in the film.  The homage to lost Americana and 'the Mother Road', Route 66 is just icing on the cake, it makes a great thing even better.  'CARS' is a worthy addition to the home DVD collection and I recommend it without reservation.  Enjoy!!

It also makes you feel good and has a great message of how friends come in all shapes in sizes and no matter where you are in life true friends will always be there for you.  That's what Cars is about.  It's about slowing down every now and then from our fast-paced, rushed world and really look at the important things in life and how beautiful life can be.  It's comical and heart-warming.  My favorite character is Mater, the old, rusted tow truck from Radiator Springs.  He is instantly likeable, with his cheerful demeanor, and comical way of life; a character that sees the good and fun in everything and everyone.  Pixar has always done great with their films and this film is especially great.  Two thumbs up for me. I recommend it to everyone.

review/text: Maybe you have to be a baby boomer to appreciate the detail and sly references made in Cars. I saw things like a Pontiac hood ornament shaped rock formation and Cadilac tailfins in the mountain range. There are so many cool "little" things in this movie that after seeing it in the theater, I had to buy the DVD. All of the Route 66 and NASCAR elements made this a movie I can watch many times, as I always notice something that I missed during previous viewings. I think that the younger viewers may not "get it". Paul Newman as a Hudson Hornet is classic and real people voiceing their cartoon characters is an added bonus.

review/summary: Amazing animation
review/text: This should have gotten the Oscar.  It is head-and-shoulders above _Happy Feet_ in all respects: The animation is better, the storyline is vastly better, and it's much less crude.  However, unlike _Happy Feet_, it's not a movie that does all the entertaining for you with cheap laughs; you have to pay attention.  I must confess that I thought the story line needed a bit of editing (was not as well-paced as the Toy Story movies), but it wasn't glaring.  The other downside is that this is not really a kids' movie.  The action is much too fast and the bulk of the humor is in cultural references and comparatively sophisticated sight gags, most of which will go right over the heads of children (and, I guess, of some adults, hence the criticism that it is "tedious").  It's an extraordinarily clever movie and can be watched several times before one catches all the little gags.  On the up side:   It lacks most of the toilet humor and thinly-disguised sexual references to which Disney seems to be resorting more and more.   The animation is mind-boggling.  Some of the scenery doesn't even look like animation, and the nuances of automotive movement (shaking smokestacks, etc.) are dead-on.  Makes _Happy Feet_ look mediocre and _Toy Story_ look like stick figures.  Absolutely a visually gorgeous movie. 3) The story line, while a bit uneven, is still better than the vast majority of animated features. 4) For those old enough to "get" them, the celebrity cameos, identifiable cars, historical references, and Americana references are priceless.  Click and Clack from NPR's "Car Talk" are not to be missed as the Rust-Eze guys.

review/summary: Great Movie!!
review/text: Cars was such a great movie!!  It is defineately for ALL ages.  There are some inside jokes for adults, funny movements for the kids, action, romance, some scientific reasoning (in turning).  The movie covers it all!  It is especially good if you know ahead of time who the voices are.  Most of us know at least one of the actors doing the voices.  It is a movie to have in your collection!

review/summary: Not just for the CG and the excitement - cool outlook and warm within
review/text: Neither a car nor a sports fan, I can still experience the excitement and fuss over the race as depicted in the first 15 minutes of the film. The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.  What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling.

review/summary: A great movie
review/text: I would have to say that I am not a car person at all, but I still enjoyed this movie very much.  We went to see it in the theater and could not wait until it came out on DVD.  My son even asked for it to be his birthday party theme and he never does TV themes.  I have read several of the reviews that people have posted on here and would have to say that I am a little concerned about the people who have a problem with the movie's language.  I do not think that it is any different then any other children's movie and a lot better then what my son comes home with from school and he is in kindergarten.  I would recommend this move to car and non car lovers alike.  A great movie sure to become a classic!

review/summary: Heart-Warming
review/text: "Cars" was an entertaining animated feature.  The story line about a racecar that is stranded in Radiator Springs was well written.  The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.  I enjoyed this movie far more than I'd anticipated I would.  It's a heart-warming tale.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Cars
review/text: To be honest, I thought I was going to hate this film.  I detest NASCAR, and would prefer to ride the bus - if my city would actually have a functioning bus line.  I was honestly surprised at the depth of character development and plot focus that was evident in this movie.  My son like the movie for the race cars (artfully done btw).  I liked the movie for the cultivation of a hero.  There weren't many (obviously) kissy-face scenes that my nine year old would pronounce *GROSSSS*, but the sweet sentiments were still there.  The artwork was fantastic.  And as someone who has lived on Rt. 66, the essence of plain, honest, living comes across beautifully.

review/summary: Perfect, perceptive, hilarious and wise. A MUST-HAVE.
review/text: Yes, "CARS" gets hyped. Yes, it's Disney-distributed. Yes, it's technically a "family" movie (cringe), but this movie has all the Pixar Animation Studios magic and covers automobile culture down to the lugnuts and wingnuts. Way funny for kids and NASCAR addicts and classic-car lovers. Great story/script, sophisticated dialogue, and voices from some of the best actors in the business.  Just like "Toy Story," this Pixar masterpiece is a blast for both kids and old geezers (I actually owned a 1949 Mercury long ago) but also captures America's popular history, in this case our complex love-affair with highways and wheels. Note that all this is on top of some of the best digital-animation & artwork in the history of movies. Ka-chow! Put this one in your collection with Disney's "Fantasia," Miyazaki's "Spirited Away," and Zemeckis' "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"

review/summary: Amusing and somewhat touching.
review/text: I kept hearing about the movie "Cars," but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.  The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.  In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.  It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.  Gary Peterson

review/summary: Two years olds favorite
review/text: Although I would only say this movie is about the same as the rest of the Pixar line-up (or maybe even a little lower) my 2 year old son has been watching it non-stop since the day of its DVD release, and it is by far his favorite children's title. It's a daily request and excellent tantrum causer when denied. We and our relatives have also contributed to the run on fossil fuels by accumulating multiple Cars license toys to go with my son's infatuation with the film. So if you are shopping for someone in the 2-5 year old male demographic, this is the movie to get. The transfer seems to be excellent and there are two short titles thrown in as bonuses that aren't bad either.

review/summary: Cars Sets a Pace
review/text: Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of "Rushmore," "Shanghai Noon" and "Behind Enemy Lines" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of "Doc Hollywood," McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in "Doc Hollywood," McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.  Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.  The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.  I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.  This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and "Cars" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in "Cars" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.  "Cars" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.  The movie is also family friendly, even for the youngest members of the family.  This movie will be one that most families will want for their DVD library.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Another hit for Pixar!
review/text: Before I start this review, let me just say that at 30 years old, I still have a soft spot for most animated movies.  I have seen every Disney/Pixar movie including this one.  When I saw the trailer for Cars before a showing of The Incredibles (the ONLY Pixar movie I own), I knew I had to see it.  Now on to my review:  After last year's dark but brilliantly done The Incredibles, Pixar decided to do a lighter and more family-friendly movie.  I saw Cars the day after it was released, and the animation is just as stunning as most of Pixar's other movies (except Incredibles which was better).  The actors providing the voices were fantastic, including Paul Newman, who voices the wise Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hornet.  While the plot was not a new one, it was great nevertheless. I especailly liked the subplot of Lightning McQueen and his love interest, a Porsche named Sally Carrera. However, the plot does drag a little bit, but the kids (ages 2 - 10) that were in the theater with me were entertained.  You have to stick around for the end credits - as with all Disney/Pixar movies, you never know what they'll do during the credits!  The short that preceded the movie, "One Man Band" was cute - it used only music and animation, not dialogue, to tell the story of two one man bands competing for a child's coin.  As I walked out of the theater smiling, there was a big crowd waiting for the next showing. I knew that Pixar would have another hit, and I was right.

review/summary: Unoriginal, but thoroughly creative and enjoyable!
review/text: I went into Cars with not very high expectations. I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.  The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.  The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.  The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.  The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.  Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.  I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults. Still, I didn't hear any kids complaining at my trip to the theatre so don't be concerned about taking them.  Pixar returns to it's roots with the same style film as Toy Story 1 & 2. It also keeps with it's tradition of being an impeccable movie studio that never fails to impress. Cars is another homerun for the studio and easily one of the best films of the year.

review/summary: SURPRISINGLY CLEVER AND ENGAGING
review/text: I doubted whether a story populated with cars could actually make an interesting movie, but boy was I wrong. Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.  Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.  It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.  The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.  It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.  Waitsel Smith

review/summary: Awesome DVD, Slick Packaging, Kids Love It
review/text: Disney's Pixar Car Cars was the number one animated feature film of 2006. If you didn't catch the movie in theaters, surely you were aware that the movie was out. The branding campaign for this movie was unprecedented it seems with available merchandise ranging from breakfast cereals to children's gym shoes, books, video games, apparel, posters and more.  Well if you didn't catch the movie in theaters the good thing is that now you can pick up the DVD. If you did check out the movie this past summer, chances are this is one that you may want to add to your DVD collection.  Cars is the story about a red race car named Lightning McQueen. It appears that he is rather new to the championship aspect of racing as he doesn't have the biggest endorsements and he is still chasing the coveted Piston Cup. On his way to the Piston Cup Championship Race, the big rig truck that is carrying him dozes off and McQueen is accidentally ejected from the rig. This leaves McQueen lost in the middle of nowhere. He rips into a really old town named Radiator Springs where he is stranded. The town needs a new road and they enlist McQueen's help. McQueen isn't quite willing to help in the beginning but he soon grows close to the people he meets in town like the rusty pick-up truck Toe-Mater and a pretty blue Porsche named Sally.  Cars is a really endearing story and the critics who hail the film as an instant classic are right on the money. It's a story you won't forget after watching it. However, the film is very long clocking in at 116 minutes, just four minutes under 2 hours. Some kids may get bored during parts of the film. The film has such a fast paced beginning and slows down drastically while McQueen is in Radiator Springs. The pace picks up again toward the end of the film after McQueen is rescued from Radiator Springs, but younger kids may have tuned out long ago.  The film is rated G, but I will note there is one scene where McQueen shouts out that he is stuck in "Hillbilly Hell."

review/summary: Pixar has done it again!
review/text: I thought this movie was great even though the story was predictable.  It kept me entertained every minute!  One of my favorite scenes was when the two Italian cars got all dressed up to cheer at a race, and I almost died laughing since they looked just like the Italians we saw here in Germany during the month of World Cup games.  I also love that Pixar takes pride in the details.  The non-talking characters in the movie were just as well thought out and lovingly crafted as the "human"  characters.  Another great thing about Pixar is they continue to entertain even after the story is over. The credits in this one were especially great. If you see it don't even think about leaving the movie theater until the credits are done rolling.  And finally, I was impressed by the number of notable people they had play caricatures of themselves. Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and his wife Lynda, Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were all in there. (Not that I knew this until I checked out the IMDB entry for the movie, but it's still cool. I'm sure there are other famous names that I just don't know since I'm not a NASCAR fan.) Aside from racing names, they also had Click and Clack from NPR, as well as Jay Leno playing a TV talk show car called "Jay Limo."  Genius!!

review/summary: Another cute one from Pixar
review/text: No doubt, there are great animations coming from lots of production companies these days. Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors. Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.  The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends. But, as with any familiar recipe, it's easy to enjoy yet another preparation of it if done well. Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life. Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself. When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do. From Doc, to Lightning, to Sally, to Mater (get it? "to mater"?), to the tractors, each comes across as a unique individual. It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.  Too bad I missed this when it first came out. It's held up well, though, and will remain enjoyable for years to come. And no, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.  -- wiredweird

The movie looked well enough on DVD on my HD setup, but on Bluray it's even more amazing it just doesn't get much better. Definately one of the best Bluray titles in our collection.

review/summary: Cars (Full Screen Edition)
review/text: Lightning McQueen, a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The animation in this movie is gorgeous, and the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. This is movie is worth seeing.

review/summary: Cars on Blu-ray is a WINNER!!!!!
review/text: When Cars first came out on DVD, I was a little disappointed because there weren't very many extras on it.  I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pixar does it again, but it had to grow on me.
review/text: When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.  You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.  Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.  The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.  Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the "acting" is top notch.  Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.  This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):  Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.  One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians "dueling" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.  Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.  End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.  Production Features include:  Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).  Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.  Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. "Radiator Springs," "Character Design," "Animation and Acting," "Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details," "Hudson Hornet," "Graphics" and "Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.  Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.  Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.  Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).  The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly. It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.  Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there.

review/summary: Blu-ray: Same 2007 release but with two collectible cars.  A great gift for a friend or family member new to Blu-ray!
review/text: "Cars" is definitely a popular Disney/Pixar classic and in terms of quality, has received the highest of rankings when it was released on Blu-ray back in 2007.  In 2009, the "Ultimate Cars Gift Pack" comes with the Blu-ray plus the original DVD and 2 exclusive cars (Cruisin' Lighting McQueen and Rescue Squad Mater) with custom Ransburg paint. These items are highly collectible and If you are looking for a holiday gift, especially for someone who owns a Blu-ray player, a die-hard "Cars" fan and loves Disney/Pixar films, you can not go wrong with this gift pack!  Definitely recommended!  In 2006, the seventh Disney/Pixar film "Cars" was released in theaters.  Needless to say, the film was a major hit as it was nominated for two Academy Awards, has made over $461 million worldwide.  In fact, the film was so popular that merchandise is still sold in department stores today and the cars have been popular toys that have made over $5 billion in sales.  Needless to say, "Cars" was not just a box office success, it is one of Disney/Pixars biggest money making titles that is loved by critics and fans that easily ensured a sequel for a planned release in 2011.  In 2009, in time for the holidays is the release of "Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack" which is a great release for those who have now jumped aboard in purchasing a Blu-ray player and a Blu-ray which was released in 2007 and has received nothing but magnificent reviews.  "Cars" is a film directed by John Lasseter ("Toy Story" films, "A Bug's Life") and co-directed by Joseph Ranft ("Monsters, Inc.", "Finding Nemo", "A Bug's Life", "The Incredibles") and features a screenplay by Lasster, Ranft, Dan Fogelman ("Bolt", "The 12th Man"), Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin and Jorgen Klubein ("A Bug's Life", "Mulan", "Pocohontaas", "The Lion King").  The film revolves around a popular rookie named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson, "Bottle Rocket", "Marley & Me") who races in the Piston Cup stock car racing competition.  Lightning McQueen is quite arrogant and not much of a team-player.  He doesn't trust his pit crew and sure enough, when he gets into a 3-car tie, the race would be determined a week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway.  While on the road to practice in California, he pushes his big rig Mack to travel all early morning but when a group of cars start becoming reckless around Mack, Lightning McQueen rolls out of the back of the big rig and ends up in the countryside.  When Lightning McQueen goes to find Mack, he ends up in a small town of Radiator Springs.  But when he gets into a problematic situation with the local Sheriff (he tears up the main road), Lightning is arrested and put in jail.  The town's judge and doctor Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "The Hustler", "Nobody's Fool")  wants him out of town but the local lawyer Sally Carrera (voiced by Bonnie Hunt, "The Bonnie Hunt Show") insists that Lightning to do community service.  And thus, Lightning must spend time with the locals of Radiator Springs where he gets to learn more about himself, making new friends such as  Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, "Blue Collar TV"), Ramone (voiced by Cheech Marin, "Lost", "Born in East LA", "Race to Witch Mountain"), Luigi (voiced by Tony Shaloub, "Monk", "Wings") and many more.

You can see the detail on the rust stains on Mater and for the most part, if you put in your DVD, you can see how much of a difference the film looks in HD via Blu-ray over its DVD counterpart.  Vibrant colors, more detail and overall, a beautiful video transfer with no blemishes, compression artifacts whatsoever.  Audio is presented in English 5.1 (uncompressed, 48 kHz/24-Bit) and the racing segments really utilize the surround channels but also the LFE.  It's one thing to have the nice clear dialogue and music through the front and center channels but to hear the cars speeding on the raceway and zooming and hearing through the surrounds is fantastic.  Crashes bring out the booms and the audience on the race track can be heard on the surround channels. Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack!  Subtitles are in English SDH.  As for the DVD, the DVD is featured in widescreen (2:39:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound EX and Dolby Digital 2.0.

I loved the film when it first came out and the film still holds up today and continues to be quite entertaining.  The picture and audio quality of "Cars" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.  As for the "Ultimate Cars Gift Pack", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that "Cars" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.  Really, there's nothing negative that can be said about "Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack".  If you have know someone who is new to Blu-ray and is a Disney/Pixar fan, this is a wonderful holiday gift to give.  It's a high quality release that is definitely recommended!

review/summary: Original and Heart Warming. 90 out of 100
review/text: After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!  With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.  I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this. A must see, and must own children's movie.  Total Score (out of 100) = 90  43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.  8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?  10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?  9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?  8 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?  Plus 2 extra bonus points for Tow Mater! Tow is a one one a kind children's movie character that will not soon be forgotten.

review/summary: Another delightful family film from Pixar
review/text: In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - "hillbilly hell".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.  Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.  The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.  Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?

review/summary: Entertaining with Likable Characters, Amazing with Rich and Beautiful Colors
review/text: The greatest thing about `Cars,' the latest film coming from Pixar, is its rich and beautiful colors of the picture. Even those who points out the weakness of the story (which resembles that of Michael J. Fox film `Doc Hollywood') would admit the merit. After all, you just cannot keep telling good stories with originality forever, and Pixar is no exception. In `Cars' the respected company has decided on seeking the originality in another direction, that is, the setting of the film, in which all the characters are really cars, trucks, or any vehicle you can see on the road.  That means you don't see any humans here. The hero of the film is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), hot shot race car who is stranded in the middle of nowhere, a sleepy town called Radiator Springs, after a series of incredible but funny misadventures. After damaging the town's main road, he is sentenced to community service in the court by Doc Hudson (voice by Paul Newman) while Lightning has to be in the next big race in California.  The town's `people' or cars are mostly misfits and rejects - the motif frequently used in Pixar films - and corky Lightning finds the life there miserable and hellish, but you know, people, no, cars change.  The film's idea about the cars and other vehicles is stretched to the point of some bizarre scenes - such as groupie cars, public restroom for cars, or car bugs that really fly - and you may not be impressed by all of them. Unlike `The Incredibles' or `Monster's Inc' the script of `Cars' is not the most original one in the marvelous history of Pixar, and the film's length (about 2 hours) makes us wish for the year 1995 when Pixar managed to make `Toy Story' that runs only 81 minutes and still is as good and enjoyable.  Still brilliant images full of striking colors and wonderful designs would appeal to everyone. The speedy car race sequences are brilliantly done, and the designs of the deserted town of Radiator Springs are often astonishingly real. And in spite of the weak story, the characters themselves are all well-written and likable, as those in the previous Pixar films are. Maybe `Cars' failed to reach the high standard of recent animations that Pixar has been pushing higher and higher, but it is still entertaining with a bit of sentimental and nostalgic feeling.

review/summary: What a soundtrack!
review/text: A lovely movie that leaves the kids with a beautiful life lesson and big time entertaining for the whole family. Main character is Lightning McQueen, a beautiful little spoiled racing car too vain of his own early success to see beyond his own unexperience. Too proud and sure of himself to rely on others' advice, and believing that he would never be in need of anyone else. When he accidentally falls off the truck that was taking him to California to participate in the Piston Racing Coup, he finds himself on his own in an unknown place. Lost and alone he gets to Radiator Springs, a long-ago forgotten community struggling to stay in business nevertheless no big roads or highways pass nearby. A bunch of colorful guys there, with engines and parts perhaps not so brand-new and shiny but with certainly far more experience will eventually make him value all those meaningful and important things that go far beyond the mere outside looks and efervescent success: friendship, companionship, experience, and love. ...And plus: what a soundtrack! Rascal Flatts' version of "Life is a highway" got me rocking all the way home after the movie theater... These guys are just purely and plainly great and make unbelievable music, even when remaking a new version of this famous 80's tune. I love them. Sheryl Crow's "Real Gone" opening theme rocks! The rest of the soundtrack is just as great combining classic tunes by Chuck Berry and James Taylor with performances by Brad Paisley, John Mayer and others. My advice: buy the movie DVD along with the soundtrack CD! You won't regret it.

review/summary: Not as good as The Incredibles, but still a master piece of CGI movie making!
review/text: A little known secret about Pixar, is their huge support for their local community.  Last night I attended a fund raiser premier of CARS at Pixar's studio's in Emeryville CA.  The event raised over $80,000 for our local school district!  So here are my thoughts on the movie.  Firstly, this is a fast paced and LOUD movie.  Those with sensitive ears should think about taking cotton buds to the theater.  Ok, I read some of the comments so far based on the teaser's and have to say that the animated cars are done wonderfully.  Each car really has it's own personality and although they do look a little cartoonish, Pixar has again shown that they can animate anything and bring it to life and then some.  The big race scenes are really only at the very beginning and at the very end, the majority of the movie is set in a small town "Radiator Springs" somewhere in the midwest just off Route 66.  I won't give too much away as far as the story goes, you'll need to go see it yourself for that.  The movie is packed full of very funny jokes and scenes, like the Tractor Tipping scene, and the SUV off-road bootcamp!  Visually, this movie is stunning.  I can't imagine the amount of research that went into producing this one.  Anyone who has driven I-40 near Amarillo TX will recognise the mountain ranges shaped like old Cadillac's burried nose down in the sand.  They really capture the road trip experience.  And the scenery is breath-taking.  Not being a big fan of "Larry The Cable Guy" I have to say that his performance as Mater the tow truck, was brilliant.  As one of the main characters, he was very funny and endearing.  Technically, Pixar really pushed the envelope again.  We're used to Pixar movies breaking ground in each movie, the underwater rendering in Finding Nemo, the fur rendering in Monsters Inc., etc.. In cars, it's all about the rendering of dust particles which looks super realistic and is not an easy thing to achieve.  Overall, this movie will have great appeal to a lot of people, although I personally think that The Incredibles is still my favorite.  This one might not win the Best Animated Feature award but I'm sure it will get awards for the technical aspects of the film.  Finally, I just want to thank Pixar once again for their amazing and continued support to the local community, whether it be fund raising events like last nights, or the masses of computers they donate to the schools, or the number of their employee's that regularly volunteer their freetime to work with the kids in mentoring programs.  I couldn't wish for a better neighbor.

review/summary: Surprisingly enjoyable for a non-NASCAR fan
review/text: I had low expectations for this film.  I think the title is pathetically uninspired and lifeless.  I thought the Cable Guy would be the overly talkative, obnoxious character like Donkey in Shrek.  And, not being a big expert/fan of cars in general, I thought I might be overall underwhelmed. But, my father wanted to see this, so I took him to see it for Father's Day.  And, I had the best day with him in a long time.  Amazingly captivating--with a few details that are culturally overplayed groaners--and well paced, CARS takes a checkered flag in my book.  I have seen probably more computer animated films than I'd like to see in one year. [I was equally surprised by Over The Hedge.  Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.  But, I wouldn't like that to ruin the film for me.  One of the funnier highlights is the use of cars as even the insects of the film.  Oh, and stay through the credits for a satisfying end note.

review/text: I am 62, and watched "Cars" with my granddaughter Brianna, who is seven. She liked it, but I enjoyed it more. Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want.

review/summary: Halfway between great and okay
review/text: Even in the teaser trailer phase of a film's release, many people were not anticipating Cars that much. Was it because they had come off the action-packed the Incredibles and people weren't exactly revving (pun maybe intended) for talking cars? Or was it just simply the idea seemed weird? Whatever the case, the general reaction upon its release was it was good-but-not-great; the one that ruined Pixar's 6 for 6 winning streak. So is it that bad? Well no, but the idea this is a horrible film is just really pushing it but it's still a lesser effort.  In a world where everyone and everything's car-related, the story centers on Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racer who only thinks of himself. After a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup and on route to California for the finals, he's accidentally dumped on the Interstate and ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. There, he meets a number of cars trying to keep their struggling town alive while Lightning learns it's better to think of more things than winning.  Let's get the good stuff out of the way. While everyone sings 3D animation praises, a slight backlash was created when Disney at one point abandoned traditional 2D thanks to the failures of Home on the Range and Brother Bear, making audiences hate 3D a bit since more and more (and more) 3D movies were being released. But still, the computer animators outdid themselves since almost every new camera angle gives us something to marvel; from the neon lights to the sheen of polished cars to the landscape. It's also a bit more movie-esque in the more bigger action scenes, making it a bit more dynamic. There's also some inspired gags like bugs that are actually Bugs as in Volkswagon Beetles while cow-tipping as been replaced by tractor tipping.  In a couple of commentaries, Pixar head John Lasseter said that a goal of Pixar was to make you see familiar worlds in a new light. Imagine toys that can talk, monsters having feelings or the burdens of being a superhero. Does anybody really wonder what a car does? While that's not to say the idea at least sounds pretty neat but it just seems awkward that we have to get sympathetic to a talking car. While I'm not being kind of pessimistic and it's unfair to say every Pixar film has to be at least masterpiece-level or it's awful, you can admit at least there's some problems with the film anyway.  One problem is the story. It's weird how there's as much as 6 people who work on the screenplay yet it feels so padded in its story. There's a whole lot of scenes that are meant to develop everyone but everyone seems kind of one-dimensional anyway and main hero Lightning just sounds like a jerk all the way through even with a newer enlightenment (could be a Owen Wilson problem though). The James Taylor "Our Town" song is meant to be the emotional scene but it pales to the Sarah McLachlan-sung "Jessie's story" scene in Toy Story 2. The voice acting is a bit more stunt casting, probably catching it from Dreamworks' tendency to get big-name stars to voice everyone.  Pixar was excellent when it came down to DVD's packed with information about making the film. Sure A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films started out kind of thin but when Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and the Incredibles had top-tier DVD's, seeing Cars quite small extras is disappointing. We get the kinda-funny short One Man Band while a new short involving the tow-truck Mater is not that funny. Everything else is light on insight and you'll instantly think of a double-dip in its future. But strangely, I ended up buying it anyway knowing there was a bigger release somewhere in the future. It'll probably come around Ratatouille's DVD release (which, by the way, looks quite promising).  I don't love the movie yet I don't outright hate it and I won't hold Pixar's past achievements against it but based on the film alone, it is a bit disappointing there's just some issues that the film has you wish were fixed.

review/text: A WONDERFUL animated film, Cars, brings to the screen the story of a race-car with its eye on the Piston Cup trophy "getting stuck" in as small town just a few days before the big event.  As it turns out though, all is not as bad as it seems... Owen Wilson (!!!), Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Michael Keaton, John Goodman, Tim Allen, Jay Leno, Billy Crystal, Cheech Marin and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT! In short, Cars is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Hoodwinked, Antz and Monsters Inc.

review/summary: What fun for the whole family!
review/text: "Cars" is a slickly-produced, delightful animated movie.  The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.  This is great family entertainment!

review/summary: Cute and Classic
review/text: 'Cars' relies on such a beautiful personification, we forget the characters are really cars.  The whole human world has been transfigured, as "Braking News" comes on television, and cars watch their fellow heroes in Nascar-type races in the stands.  Playfully, we enter into the world of "Lightning McQueen" (Owen Wilson) who is trying to win his first "Piston Cup".  He is full of himself and not just engine oil, so he lazily creates a three-way tie with two other prima dona cars.  The tie-breaker takes place in California, but his smugness gets him off guard, and he is stuck with a sleepy desert town, Radiator Springs, off Route 66.  Here he meets some interesting fellow cars, including Hudson "Doc" Hornet (Paul Newman), a former racer and the town's judge, a rundown tow truck, Mater (Larry, the Cable Guy), and Sally, a Porche from L.A., enjoying the slower life as a lawyer in the country.  There's a love interest, but her distaste for his ego provides a series of events to have his egomania retreaded.  'Cars' has a lot of heart inside its chasis.  We forget we are dealing with cars that our laughter and tears come to the fore without us thinking about it.  It's the human comedy with a theme to reflect on slowing down and enjoying the road(s) in life.  Surprisingly effective, the story is beautifully executed with nuances like vocal appearances by Bob Costas and Richard Petty, which authenticate the movie even more.  'Cars' is the best of a great lot of animated features this year.  While 'Curious George' and 'Monster House' help reinvent animation, 'Cars' gets to the finish line better with a great story and a funny, touching delivery.

review/text: OMG, I can't tell you how hard I laughed at this movie! I wasn't sure I was going to like it, because it was 'cartoon' and that's not my favorite type of movie to watch, but I've enjoyed Pixar creations in the past, so I figured I'd give it a try, and my kids really wanted to go. When it was over, I wanted to watch it again, because I missed so much of it the first time--from laughing!  When "Jr." came out, who happens to be the driver my ex loved the most, I was laughing so hard I couldn't see! The comparison to real life celebrities, racers, and past celebrities was simply brilliant. There is great humor here along with some innuendo that made it fun for grown ups and kids alike. It's fast paced enough that there's not a lot of down time from one belly laugh to the next... and if you have ever been on a farm or know about cow-tipping, the tractor tipping scene is going to have you rolling on the floor!  My son was laughing so hard in parts he couldn't catch his breath.  I highly recommend this as a family movie that both children and adults will love. There's even a moral lesson thrown in about responsibility, honoring commitments, not being to prideful, etc. Worth the cost to add to your collection.

review/summary: KA-CHOW!  Disney & Pixar have done Again, Lighting McQueen Rollin' Along
review/text: From the manufacters of Finding Nemo & the Incredibles comes a delightful & thrilling story in a world where cars speak for themselves with voice talents of the legendary Paul Newman & Owen Wilson, Owen Wilson stars as Lighting McQueen, a cocky famous race car who gets waylaid in a small Arizona town called Radiator Springs while on his way to the big race, the Piston Cup, while there he discovers the meaning of friendship. Cheech Marin, Bonnie Hunt and of course John Ratzenberger voice in this once again well done Disney & Pixar triumph, Disney & Pixar can not fail. It's exciting entertainment with the same fantasy that surrounded "Toy Story" if you seen the last 6 Disney & Pixar films continue with "CARS" Disney & Pixar make the best computer animated films

review/summary: Should Have Won The Oscar. Ka-Chow!
review/text: From the opening scene to the final roll of the credits, Cars was a delight for me and my whole family. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship.  Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.  The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.  I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour. I'm not completely crazy.)  From my two-year-old on up, everyone in my family enjoyed Cars, and I actually came to like Owen Wilson as well.

review/summary: An instant classic!
review/text: We bought Cars for our 2 1/2 year old as soon as it came out and I've lost count at how many times we've watched it together. First, it's just plain beautiful to look at. The computer animation is absolutely state of the art and makes things like Toy Story look downright crude by comparison.  Secondly, it creates characters you can love and laugh with. All the actors who do the voices are fantastic! The story is heartwarming and gives a great message, without being condescending or politically correct. There is lots of humor for kids, as well as subtle stuff for parents to enjoy too.  My only complaint I was hoping for more Bonus Feature material. The two short films "Mater and the Ghostlight" and "One Man Band" are great and I guess I just wish there were more extras like them. The storyboard type stuff was so-so.  I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I can't remember the last movie I enjoyed watching over and over again so much. Seems like every time I watch it, I see some new little subtle thing I missed before. Oh yeah, our son loves it too! I only hope Disney releases a Platinum Edition with more CG extras. And no, I don't work for Disney/Pixar.

review/summary: Cars with a Lesson
review/text: Cars is an enjoyable movie even if you're not "into" racing.  You can almost see the actors in each car - there is so much personality.  The movie starts with a "If you're not a winner, you're a loser" (as Ricky Bobby would have said in Talladega Nights) theme that gradually changes to show children and adults that caring and friendship is much more powerful than being Number 1.  The cars and trucks will delight all children and the subtle, and not always so subtle, connections to real-life will have adults laughing on the floor.  For those who are "into" racing, you'll notice lots of similarities to real-life racing and commentator personalities.

review/summary: Great flick, on several levels
review/text: This is a great flick that grows on one with multiple viewings.  It appeals on several levels:  - Technical virtuosity and animation. Hey, it's Pixar.  - Characters.  Lightning IS a hotshot youngster in for some learning.  The Sheriff is, well, the Sheriff.  Doc Hudson is - or comes to be - sympathetic.  You root for him and for Lightning at the end.  -  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, "the Mother Road."  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, "I fell in love." The film is poetry at times.  -  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.  I remember back then that even street Hudsons were low-slung somethings special.  -  Just plain fun.  I wish the scene where the cars are boogey-dancing down the street could have gone on and on.  That Sheriff moved so cool.  The two Italians were sweet, too (the tire shop owner is a Fiat 500, by the way, Italy's remarkable postwar little two-cylinder car that went everywhere from the highest Alps to the lowest valleys).

review/summary: Actually 4.5 stars would be my vote.
review/text: I really like this feature length animated film.  It's a lot of fun for the entire family and holds up to repeated viewings.  The vocal performances by the cast are very nicely executed, it has a sweet moral integrity message, and EXCELLENT production quality overall.  As an adult, however, I can't rate it up there with the best of this genre, which (in my opinion) include "The Invincibles," "Toy Story," "Nemo," or "Shrek" for a few reasons.  Although good, the writing seems a little less sophisticated, the jokes aren't quite as clever, and the plot is not as imaginative as one would hope.  That said, "Cars" is a fine flick that I'm very happy to own.

review/summary: HAPPY MOTORING!
review/text: "Cars", the latest offering from the animation geniuses at Pixar, is a sweet little movie that combines a witty (and spectacular) look at NASCAR racing with a leisurely story line that harks back to simpler times on the road. All the characters are- yes- cars! This may take a little getting used to, but it works well.    Our hero, cocky young race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), earns his way into a race-off for the Piston Cup, but he falls out of his truck and winds up in the colorful, but faded, Western town of Radiator Springs (a beautifully rendered duplicate of northern Arizona). There, he does community service as a paver while meeting the various  "car-acters" in town. The most interesting of these is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a sleek vintage '51 Hudson Hornet who serves as mayor, judge and doctor. There's also Mater, the zany tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy); Sally, the Porsche and former hotshot LA lawyer (a likable Bonnie Hunt), and a great little comic-relief duo: Luigi and Guido, the Italian-accented Fiat and forklift who run a tire store (Tony Shalhoub). Lightning  learns a little more about life and returns to the speedway a new man- I mean car. It's all nicely done and has a different kind of feel than other Pixar movies- more of an easy-going road trip than a slam-bang adventure or undersea odyssey. The racing sequences, narrated by real-life announcers Bob Cutlass (I mean, Costas) and Darrell Waltrip, add genuine excitement that even non-gearheads like me will love. Did we mention that even the announcers are cars?    "Cars" comes in a package that's a little slimmer than the other Pixar DVDs, but this movie looks good. Two shorts, the cute "One Man Band"  (two street musicians, a boy, and an Italian town square) and "Mater and the Ghostlight", are part of it along with a short but interesting documentary that details Pixar honcho John Lasseter's surprising car background (his dad ran a body shop), love of Route 66-style road culture and research into NASCAR broadcasts. There's also an epilogue with little spoofs of past Pixar hits like "Monster Trucks, Inc." that will delight outtake fans. Musical choices include the doo-wop classic "Sh-Boom" (the Chords' version) and, at the end, a nifty take on "Route 66" by John Mayer. Randy Newman's back, too, with the poignant "Our Town" (sung by James Taylor).    "Cars" may not wow you at first, aside from the racing portions, but it will grow on you. It might be a little slow in parts for the very young. Give it a spin- you'll enjoy this ride.

review/summary: Best of 2006
review/text: "Cars" is the inventive, creative, and entertaining animated film of the year.  Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides.  The characters' witty names reflect their personalities and help with screen play motion:  "Lightening McQueen" (Bullitt and the Cooler King would've driven this racer), "The King" (Petty's Superbird always grabs my attention!), "Tow Mater", etc.  This movie is brilliant and funny.  Your entire family will enjoy this DVD.  Your little ones will, especially, like it.  I always prefer the wide screen version, but have also watched a friend's full screen "Cars".  Both are great.  If you want good clean fun, with a poignant moral at the end (honor, loyalty, and friendship are more important than winning, fame, and money!) then "Cars" is the fun-flick for you.  Race down your DVD soon!  Happy Thanksgiving!

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: This movie is so perfect.  It is filled with the funny scenes and excitement.  This is a well-made movie.  For the story, it is very straight forward that Lightning McQueen is attempted to go to California for the tiebreaker race.  However, during that time, he has to face a tough time when his delivery truck suddenly falls off and McQueen falls out of the truck and when he chases the truck back by speeding, he is caught by police and he has to do a community service and the time is against him too, he has to beat his pressure to secure a spot for that important race for him.  This story although is kind of easy to understand, it is basically good.  For the acting, they are all good.  For the direction, it is fantastic because all the scenes are logical.  My favorite part for this movie is the visual.  They are so funny and of course, Ka-Chow!  For the music, the songs feature in this movie is fantastic.  For the sound effects, they are all fantastic as well.  Overall, this is a good movie.

review/summary: Much better than expected
review/text: Over the past 5 or 6 years, I've noticed a downward trend on the quality of animated films.  All use the same tired plot devices, animation looks the same, and the worst trend seems to be the focus on using Hollywood stars to do the voices.  Needless to say, I didn't rush out to see 'Cars' in the theater.  I only watched under duress on a long flight to Tokyo.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised...after a few minutes, I was hooked.  The plot in parts reminded me of a bad 80s movie starring Michael J. Fox, but it seemed to work  when acted out by talking cars.  I also have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of Larry the Cable Guy...Git R Done may have been funny the first time he said it....but, his tow truck character Mater was one of the more likeable and entertaining cars in the movie.  Overall, a good animated film...probably the best I've seen since the first Shrek.

review/summary: Slick Movie With Lots of Heart
review/text: My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.  I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)  The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the "fumes" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of "Radiation Stinks" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)  Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have "heart" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an "empty cup" (like the Piston Cup).  The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute "Inspiration for Cars" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)  Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)  However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: "You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college."  This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.  There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)  As I said, the extras are slim pickins:  --New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)  --Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)  --John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)  --Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)  --Deleted scenes  This is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot! Goes to show that one doesn't HAVE to be into cars to enjoy this movie.)

review/summary: The fleeting nature of fame
review/text: This animated movie was way above our expectations. It was very entairtaining both for us and or our 3 year old son. The way cars are presented with eyes and a talking mouth is so original and so nicely done.  Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson lent his voice for this character) is  going up the steps of glory and fame really fast until he gets lost on Route 66 and find himself lost in Radiator Springs. There he meets with many different types of cars. Some of them used to be big stars long time ago. As a result he discovers that fame, front covers, and spotlights do not last forever. On the other hand he discovers values that are long lasting such as true friendship and family.  I want to make a special mention to the little italian blue forklift and yellow italian car named Guido and Luigi respectively. Their characters are the funniest in the movie. They will really make you laugh.  I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment. By the way I do not think it is valid to compare this movie with other Disney classics. Pixar has started a new type of animated movies that is a league of its own and I am sure they will withstand the test of time becoming thus classics.

review/summary: An instant classic
review/text: Pixar movies are known for artistic achievements in the fields of computer animation; and for their accesible storytelling, which is even true at the film considered most "adult" by many audiences: The Incredibles.  Many critics have panned "Cars" by calling it cliched and predictable, cheesy and formulaic. Yes, it might be cliched and predictable, it might have a lot of cheese and it follows the "we-teach-you-sound-values" formula. But then, why is it that this movie is striking a chord on many people? Maybe is it because we have precisely forgotten about these values?  In this era and age of Instant Messaging, Blackberry, "Date Movies" and Tarantino gore, sometimes you welcome an effort like "Cars". You need to be reminded that we get so stuck in our own goals, our jobs, our careers and where we want to get, that we tend to forget what's important and to take a pause and enjoy all the blessings surrounding us. And that's the message this movie brings us, which is a lot deeper that the "talking car" facade might lead us to believe.  Lightning McQueen is a hot-shot rookie in the world of stock car racing; he's so much into his own success and arrogance he has forgot the fact no one is an island. He will get a heavy dose of reality while being lost, finding Route 66, a forgotten town, love and friendship; while learning about a place that was scratched off the map because of so-called "progress".  Sometimes a message like that is stronger if we take the context out of our own backgrounds and place them somewhere else. And that's precisely what Pixar does by bringing fantasy characters that have some credibility on them (talking cars that actually bend and move like real cars) to that context, while not forgetting the comedy and a lot of humor. So many jokes are there you'll need the DVD version to get them all.  The soundtrack is dead on-target, from the rockin' "Real Gone" by Sheryl Crow, serving as an almost operatic introduction to McQueen to the teary "Our Town" by James Taylor and a nice version of "Life is a Highway" by Rascal Flatts.  Yes, the movie is a bit long, but we in the audience at the theatre didn't really feel it; you won't help but feel identified with the characters: my girlfriend and I looked at some scenes in which McQueen and Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) were involved, and we saw ourselves reflected at those characters and personalities (Yes, I'm a tad cocky and career-oriented, sorry folks).  I'm not a fan of Disney movies and I have entirely avoided animation pictures, including all of Pixar's previous efforts, except for The Incredibles on HBO. But something told me I should watch this one, and I am not disappointed. There must be something powerful about an animated movie that makes you put your life into a new perspective, and finish your day praying and thanking God for all the wonderful things you enjoy, most especially your family and friends.  Life is indeed a journey, and there a lot of things to be enjoyed and learned while you get to your destination, including friendship and sportsmanship. And that message some people might call "dated" to be reflected in movies, is precisely the kind of message I'd like to bring and pass to my children, if I ever am blessed to have them.

review/text: You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, so even though Cars is about, well, race cars, racing, and driving in a world filled with cars (and no people), I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. It's filled with interesting characters from Mater the tow truck to Guido the forklift and the stars of the film are as usual interesting and entertaining.  Lightning McQueen is self-centered and arrogant but when after a three-way tie for first place in the Piston Cup, he gets lost on the way to the tie breaker race and ends up in Radiator Springs. He's sentenced to community service and tries to weasel out and escape his obligation. The towns autos keep him close and eventually he begins to see that not all the world is involved in racing and speed isn't what life is all about.  The realization is a bit abrupt but then it's film. The movie is also filled with lots of sight gags and in jokes some for the kids and some for adults and some for all ages. There's a lot that applies to life and just a lot of wonderful Route 66 trivia. Give it a chance.

review/summary: fantastic animation but too often stuck in neutral
review/text: ***1/2  So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles?  "Cars," the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings.  It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen.  The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices.  It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the "eyes" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).  Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse.  While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town.  The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations.  It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn`t winning the big race).  The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival.  There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town`s medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo.  There's also an assortment of ethnic types with thick accents to flesh out the scene and indicate what a melting pot even an America made up entirely of motor vehicles would be.  A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman.  You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie.  Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.  It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, "Cars" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features.  Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile.  Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and "drive" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip.  Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves.  For a movie built entirely on driving, "Cars" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.  The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to "drag" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does.  There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter.  In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as "The Great Race,"  "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" or "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" as its source of inspiration.  Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.  The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film.  These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer.  But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, "Cars" is too often stuck in neutral.

review/summary: Movie with a heart
review/text: I have a four yr old little boy who loves all kinds of trucks and cars.  He could give you the names of all his vehicles long before he could identify his colors.  So when we saw the movie trailers for "Cars" on the computer, I knew that we needed to get this one.  As one of his Christmas gifts it is quickly becoming his new, all-time favorite.  It takes the self-centered racing car, Lightning McQueen and side-tracks him in a sleepy old town that the interstate by-passed.  During his week of community service, he makes friends and finds out that there is more to life than living in the fast lane.  It is a wonderful movie and well worth watching it over and over as four year olds love to do.

review/summary: Veering Off the Highway
review/text: Cars, while technically proficient with some beautiful animation and backgrounds, is probably the weakest of the Disney/Pixar productions.  There didn't seem to be much heart in the story and even when suspending disbelief, it was difficult to get the mind around the premise that cars inhabited this world.  The story did pick up with the tractor tipping scene, but overall, it was somewhat less than satisfying.  For a collector of the Pixar efforts, I think the movie should definitely be included as it demonstrates how Pixar is evolving as it continues to turn out movies - but this is certainly not one of their best.

I think the sound track is excellent--we have that CD as well.  I love the way the main character, Lightning McQueen, who is all about himself and winning the Piston Cup (think NASCAR racing), eventually learns to value others and their relationships with him.  It also gives my kids and myself a little history story about Route 66 and its importance to America.  This DVD is very worth buying!

review/text: The movie is Great!! Don't take me wrong. The reason why I gave 3 points instead of 5 is because of the languages issue. Disney's movies in the past gave you the options to buy multi-language movies, we are Latin's and we would like to pass that to our kids. Disney's translations to other languages are THE BEST so is a good teaching to our kids to watch the movie in Spanish one time and the next in English, like that they learns both languages well. But Now Disney doesn't give you the alternative to buy one movie with 3 options of languages on it. You have to buy EVERY version with the language you desire. Before you paid $23+ for a multi-language movie today you pay $15 for one with only the option in English.

review/summary: This Will Make You Want to Drive Down Route 66
review/text: When I was in high school in the 60's, my family took me on a trip across the United States. It left such an impression that I took my family on a similar trip a few years back. However, it was not as enjoyable and this movie helped me to understand why. We stayed on the freeways the second time around and did not get on the rural roads to see the real America.  Cars is the best animated Disney movie I have every seen. It has great graphics, is funny (Larry the Cable as 'Mater is hilarious), tells a good story and reminds all of us that true American values are alive and well and meaningful living is still taking place in small towns all across America that have been bypassed long ago by the expressways.  Cars sends a strong message to its viewers in this fast paced world we live in ... slow down and smell the roses. There is a Route 66 out there that has many wonderful things to show you. Take it.

review/text: The first few minutes of CARS I thought to myself, "Another boring kids' movie I have to sit through."  I am not a big NASCAR fan and it seemed like the racing just went on and on.  Then the leading car of the film, "Lightning McQueen", anxious to make it to California for THE BIG RACE, finds himself stuck in an old town off of Route 66.  From that point on I was hooked.  This is my favorite Pixar/Disney film, in fact one of the top ten films I saw all year (2006).  I love all the characters and fell in love again with Paul Newman playing an old Hudson Hornet!  It had a wonderful message for kids and adults.  I think I might even become a NASCAR fan!  I am definitely a "Cars" fan!!

Only certain U.S. retail store chains have gotten them and their second discs are different, so you have to buy them all to get all of the extras.  Even the acclaimed Australian 2-Disc DVD doesn't have all of the extras that are on the U.S. retail stores second disc.  Why Buena Vista decided to market this movie this way can only mean a real 2-Disc version will be made available to everyone next year after their exclusive contracts expire.

review/summary: These cars are just too sweet!
review/text: Criticism of this movie is a mystery to me. My kids has so far place this movie on there top ten mini lists. I have yet to see a bad Pixar film (even "A Bug's Life" is still entertaining, for kids anyway) and the only reason that I can think of is how difficult it is to follow a film of such real quality like "The Incredibles". I'm honestly struggling to think of a fault with this film which is bright, colourful, noisy and funny - perfect for the younger members of your family. But there is also more than enough for the adults to enjoy as well, not even mentioning the exceptionally high standard of animation and voice casting. "Cars" introduces us to a world where there are no people and cars are alive (and not just cars - helicopters, SUVs, tractors, you name it).  Once you've adjusted yourself to the quirky world of "Cars" then you're in for a real treat. The first thing you notice is the epic scale of the thing and how wonderful it all looks. Whether it's crowded stands at a stadium or the timeless beauty of the Grand Canyon, Pixar provides further proof (if any were needed) that they are the new masters of animation. Everything is bright and full of colour and life and after a while, you even forget that you're watching a cartoon altogether! I thought that a new standard had been reached in animation with "The Incredibles" but this looks even better than that. The voice casting is also superb, as always, with Newman and Wilson leading a cast of real quality. Even finding Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Schumacher in cameos was a real blast, although American audiences probably would have enjoyed (and recognised) Jay Leno or Mario Andretti a bit more. Some characters maybe weren't as defined as others - low-rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and 50's cruiser Flo (Jenifer Lewis) weren't as defined as others and didn't feel part of the story - but with so much on screen (especially during the race sequences), it's easy to lose some aspects of the film in the noise and spectacle.  The dialogue is littered with one-liners while references and in-jokes abound (Lightning's tyre, for example, are called "Lightyears"). The pace of the movie also fitted the story - fast and loud at the start, slow and quiet in Radiator Springs - and the whole thing is filled with the typically enthusiastic imagination that Pixar infuse their pictures with. However, for all of the technical brilliance of "Cars", I still prefer "The Incredibles" - it's more fun and doesn't sag in the middle as much as this did. But "Cars" is still a wonderful film and one that appears to have been underrated already by certain other critics. Don't listen to them - this is a family film of genuine class and quality and you'll be missing out if you don't watch it. Vroom-vroom!

review/text: Man, I cannot believe Pixar.  I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do.  Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help.  However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.  Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations.  I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too).  I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas.  Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.  It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.  These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.  --PolarisDiB

review/summary: How Long Before They Change the Name to Pixarland?
review/text: 4 and 1/2  I will never, for the life of me, understand why Michael Eisner, the former head of Disney, even entertained the notion of ending Disney's relationship with Pixar. Disney's recent animated efforts pale in comparison to Pixar's. For proof of this, take a look at the Disney theme parks; Pixar characters are everywhere, in rides, as characters meeting the public, in parades, in shows. You would be hard pressed to find any representation from "Treasure Planet", "Chicken Little" or "Hercules". You might see Chicken Little doing a `Character Meet and Greet', but that's about it. Disney needs Pixar. And vice versa. No other movie studio has a marketing machine geared towards and a reputation for family films.  The two are a match made in heaven.  When you produce such consistently great films, as Pixar does, it becomes necessary to rate them against themselves. There is no other scale; they have raised the bar too high. Rating "Cars" on the same scale as DreamWorks's "Over the Hedge" just isn't going to work. "Hedge" is good, but Pixar films are in a class by themselves. It becomes a matter of is it "Toy Story/ The Incredibles" good or simply "Monsters, Inc" good? "The Incredibles" and the "Toy Story" films represent modern examples of perfection in the art of animation. For that matter, there are few live action films that can compare. "A Bug's Life" and "Monsters, Inc" are both very good, but they aren't perfect. "Cars", the newest film from Pixar, with the voice talents of Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenberger, is very good, but it's "Monsters, Inc." good. It isn't perfect.  Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a rookie car on the Piston Cup circuit, has the moves and attitude to win the Cup, upsetting the King (Richard Petty), the veteran in his last race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), the venerable also-ran determined to win. After a three-way tie, the cars head out to California to perform for the title. Lightning upsets his third pit crew of the year, all of whom quit, and he sets off to California with simply his truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). Lightning pressures Mack to drive through the night and along the way, Lightning gets separated and lost. He ends up in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town on Route 66, far off the interstate. Disoriented, Lightning causes some damage and Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche, who lives in the town wants to see the damage repaired, pressuring Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's judge, to order Lightning to fix the road before he leaves. Determined to get to California, Lightning tries to fulfill his duty but gets distracted by the residents of Radiator Springs.  Directed by John Lasseter ("Toy Story" and its sequel), "Cars" is a beautiful, richly detailed look at a world where cars live just like humans. Nearly great, the film has many things going for it and one key thing working against it.  Both a brilliant idea for an animated film and a brilliant marketing concept, "Cars" has a lot going for it. With NASCAR gaining popularity every week, this animated effort seems guaranteed to receive some cross-over. Also, how quickly can they retrofit the Speedway attractions at the theme parks? Let's freshen those babies up.  From the opening scenes, depicting a race at the Motor Speedway of the South, the computer generated animation is flawless in design and detail. Really, the only detail telling us this film is animated is the faces on the cars. Beyond that, the scenery and production design are flawless. We believe we are watching a real race at a real speedway (complete with cars filling the stands, doing the wave, and RVs parked in the center of the track) and the scenes of Lightning speeding through the landscape look like they were filmed, the landscapes appear so real I could almost smell the pine trees and the desert wind blowing across the open plain. The shots of Lightning and Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning. When they visit Ornament Valley, the rocks are beautiful and look like hood ornaments. When the race car arrives at Radiator Springs, the filmmakers have created a loving tribute to the little towns, motels, businesses, tourist attractions and icons which used to dot Route 66 during its heyday.  All of the cars are created with loving detail, each based on an actual car or vehicle. Even the car governor of California is a Hummer with an Austrian accent. Lightning is a race car, I'm going to guess a Mustang, I couldn't quite identify him, but Porsches, Ferraris, Buicks, Hudson Hornets and more, both old and new, make an appearance.  The voice talents are, as always, exceptional. Owen Wilson brings the right blend of cocky upstart and guts to Lightning McQueen.  When he eventually realizes what his life is missing, and what he needs to do to fix it, we believe it. Paul Newman is perfect as Doc Hudson, the elder statesman of Radiator Springs. Once a powerful, cocky star in his own right, he prefers the quiet life in his little town. I read Newman, car buff that he is, suggested his character's make and model, giving Doc Hudson even more detail. He also has the right amount of gravelly intonation for a car fifty plus years old; you can imagine the carburetor adding to Doc's voice, in much the way Newman's voice adds resonance to the character. Hunt is good as the Porsche looking to protect and preserve the town and its inhabitants. Larry the Cable Guy is amusing as Tom Mater, the tow truck who is a few spark plugs short of a full engine. Tony Shalhoub plays Luigi, a little Italian car who runs the local tire shop and is obsessed with all things Ferrari. A number of real-life race car drivers make cameos as their cars and Tom and Ray, the Car Talk Guys from NPR, play the owners of Lightning's poorly funded sponsors.  I have to give a lot of credit to Pixar. They could've so easily made the race cars even more realistic and covered them with real sponsors, much like the real thing. Thankfully, we are spared from watching endless logos for Home Depot and the like. Instead, all of the sponsors are fictional, and provide a level of humor to the tale. Lightning's sponsors are Rust-Eze, the rear bumper rust lubricant. He longs to be sponsored by Dinoco, a large oil company. Get it? Dinoco, large oil company. Dinosaurs. Oil. Chick (Keaton) is sponsored by HTB, Hostile Takeover Bank. These are cute jokes, some of which are worked into the story, providing another level of detail to an already richly observed universe.  The problem with "Cars" is pacing. The film seems long and ten or fifteen minutes edited out middle would've improved the film greatly, giving it a faster rhythm, making it nearly unforgettable. As it is, the middle drags and we begin to fidget in our seats a bit.  "Cars" is fun, amusing and brilliantly designed. Sure to provide amusement for everyone in the family. As I have said many times, the mark of a classic animated film is it entertains the kids as well as the adults who have to take them. Would it entertain just adults? I heard a lot of laughter from adults, and a lot of laughter from the kids. At times a chorus, at others one group could be heard over the other. I can't imagine a better family film until maybe the next Pixar release, in summer, 2007, "Ratatouile", about a rat trying to eat good food in Paris.

review/summary: Get your kicks on Route 66!
review/text: This is, perhaps, my favorite movie of any genre of all time. Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to "save ten minutes" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society. The funniest scenes: tractor tipping and Mack making faces in the tank truck reflection.

review/summary: KA-CHOW!!  PIXAR In the WINNER'S CIRCLE  again
review/text: Pixar's animation studio has not only been the go-to studio to continuely raise the bar for CG animation, but PIXAR pretty much created the bar itself. One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing "The Incredibles" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning "Finding Nemo" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and "A Bug's Life" none at all. So now with "CARS" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.  Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's "Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're "Lightyears" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!  The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young "oh-too-full-of-himself rookie" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him  through the race. This clich&#65533; is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.  Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry "TCG"  as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar "good luck charm" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the "CAR TALK" brothers "Click & Clack" on board, they so needed to advice us not to "drive like my brother." Great!  Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06.  The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes.

review/text: The original release on DVD was good enough but this Blu Ray release is a just great!  If you have the proper equipment, and you know who you are, this is a MUST HAVE!  It'll be playing in a lot of big screen high end audio showrooms for a long time to come.  Or it should be.  This is way the High Def format was invented.  Bravo to all involved.  It has finally sold me on the Blu Ray format over the excellent HD DVD format.  This is just video and audio nirvana!  Can it even get any better than this?  It cost a bit more, but for this level of excellence it doesn't matter.  This is still cheaper than the least expensive LaserDisc and it just doesn't come close in quality.  WOW!!!  Visually it is beyond perfect and the Dolby Digital 5.1 (actually 7.1) sound is just awesome.  This is just another Pixar masterpiece...

review/summary: Pixar does it yet again!
review/text: How can Pixar continue to amaze us with each movie they do, and continue to raise the bar each time?  Story.  Story, and incredible animation.  Their movies aren't the simple thrown-together-done-on-a-computer-and-get-it-out-quick-for-some-quick-money computer animated movies as of late.  Their storys have heart.  A lot of heart.  And yes, their animination is second to none.  Cars is no different.  I'm not huge into Nascar, but this movie appeals on so many levels, there's something for everyone in it.  I won't rehash the plot here.  Trust me, it's very good.  You'll love the voice talent, you'll love the animation, and Pixar's never ending inside jokes thoughtout the movie.  And if you're a Pixar fan, you'll die over the end credits.  Buy this.  You will NOT be disapointed.

review/summary: One of the best
review/text: Car was one of the best movies that I've seen with my five year old thus far.  I did not go out and see it at first. My friend was talking about how great the movie was. I was basically getting tired of the same line of up of characters in the movies, talking animals, abandoned animals, ,etc. The hype about this movie was another factor in whether or not I was going to take my child to see it. It appeared that every one was trying to ride on the Car's band wagon, with so many companies trying to profit from it, it's a wonder if the movie was any good.  I was floored, the movie was awesome, I am a grown woman and cannot WAIT until it is released to DVD so I can watch it over (and over and over) again with my son.  The characters were perfectly aligned together to make an all-star cast, there is no need in making a part two, I see no way that you can top this one!

review/summary: A good family film, but somehow we expect more than good from Pixar
review/text: Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary "fish out of water" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any "wow" factor.  The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.  The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star "Lightning McQueen" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.  But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.  The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.  Still, a pretty good movie.  Just not up to the standards we expect from Pixar.

review/summary: Question on Cars...
review/text: First, this movie is great. End of Story. My husband and I watch MANY children movie and cartoons with our 3 y/o - by force AND by choice. We started our Disney collection 10 years before we decided to have children!  Some are really really lame (Doogal), some will be loved forever (too many to list) some are worshiped as classics (Shrek, Hoodwinked).  I would say we are pretty good judges of cartoon styles and presentation...  Cars is up on the loved list.  I will not get tired of this movie....EVER!  Especially appreciate the silence at the Rust Eze after party when someone shouts "FREEBIRD".....  I snorted in the theatre.  But one thing tripping me up is that I remember the twins (Tia and Mia - who are the fans who follow McQueen and then Chick, and I recall them lifting their wheel wells as if to "flash" them...) and in my WalMart purchased DVD I do not find this scene.  Anyone else miss this?  What else did they take out and was it Pixar or WalMart who made these edits.  Do tell me all your secrets of the trade!

review/summary: Charming and Smart
review/text: The beginning of Cars is a little lame since the beginning race goes on a little too long and it's not either very entertaining or funny. The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.    At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film "thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt all do fine jobs.

review/summary: Cars is about the journey, not the destination
review/text: The Pixar team has infinite creative brain cells. They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.  This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.  The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.  "Cars" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.  While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the "weird" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.  That a coveted trophy is -after all- "just an empty cup".  Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough. Maybe it's because the storyline is not that original, maybe it's something else. But it's certainly a lovely movie, and one hell of a ride.

review/summary: Pixar has done it again
review/text: Who would have thought a movie about cars could have so much heart? Not me, and honestly I went into this movie with low expectations, despite the fact that so many Pixar movies are so well done. Well, boy was I surprised.  The beginning of the movie was much like I expected the entire movie to be..loud and fast, with so much going on onscreen you can't keep track of it all. But the movie switches tone and pacing when the star racecar ends up (by accident) in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, with a bunch of good-ol-boy cars who haven't heard of the Piston Cup and just want to bring their little town back to its heydey glory.  Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as Mater, the tow truck who befriends the self-centered racecar and inadvertently helps to teach him the value of teamwork and putting others before yourself.  Overall a great movie and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I could not believe how down right fun this movie is.  The added benefit was seeing it in the El Capitan in Hollywood.  With the organ grinding away as you enter, then, getting to see a pit crew in action and then some kids getting up on stage, wow, then the movie.  The review of the movie tells a lot of the plot, but the sond "Finding Yourself" really reveals the story.  When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.  What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.  The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.  The animation is just outstanding, the sound track, wow, what great songs.  I think this may be one of Pixar's greatest movies.  "Find yourself" seeing cars.

review/summary: Not firing on all pistons, but Pixar's "Cars" is still fine family enteratinment for the summer of 2006
review/text: "Cars" may well be the least of the Pixar animated films put out by Disney, in which case the future of computer animated films remains exceedingly bright.  The story starts with the final race for the Piston Cup, in which rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is tied with The King (Richard Petty) and bad car Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) for the lead.  The arrogance of youth costs Lightning the race and the three way tie requires one more race a week later in California for the title and the lucrative endorsement.  But on the way there Lightning get separated from Mack (John Ratzenberger), the big rig in which he travels, and ends up making the mistake of speeding through the town of Radiation Springs.  So instead of preparing for the big race, he is doing community service in a town that has been bypassed by the Interstate and all but forgotten.  Radiation Springs, of course, is filled with all sorts of interesting cars.  Lightning is arrested by the Sheriff (Michael Wallis), and sentenced to repair the road by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman in a masterstroke of casting), at the insistence of Sally Careera (Bonnie Hunt), who runs the motel and is also the city attorney.  Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's new friend and teaches him the joys of midnight tractor tipping, while Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) wants to sell him tires.  There is also Flo (Jenifer Lewis) at the diner, and Sarge the Jeep (Paul Dooley) and Filmore the VW Bus (George Carlin) from the 60s rubbing each other the wrong way.  There is also a tin Lizzie (Kathrine Helmond), who still remembers when the place was founded by Stanley the Steamer.  There are a series of lessons that Lightning needs to learn, and this film goes through all of them right by the numbers.  Things might get a bit predictable, but there is a nice surprise at the end when Lightning puts winning in its proper place, so the little kids are clearly ahead of the game at the end of this one.  More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of "House of Wax").  This is a move about cars, but it is also once that celebrates the past and the wonders of nature as well as what fast driving machine can do.  Plus, this is a film that has Bonnie Hunt be a Porsche, which is certainly a bit of type casting that only us older folks can appreciate.  Final Note: The name of Lightning McQueen is apparently a reference to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died in 2002, but it also clearly resonates in terms of Steve McQueen, whose legendary car driving in "Bullitt" is still well remembered.

Cars is one of those movies that draws you in. I was impressed to be in a theater crowded with smaller children,and not hear a peep out of them.

review/summary: Not PIXAR's Best, But Still a Great Movie to See
review/text: I just watched this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised--I mean, I thought it was going to be cute, but nothing special.  And STILL Pixar pulled off another win.  The lack of wall-to-wall advertising worried me--maybe less work had gone into this than into other 3D movies that were currently taking precedent.  After all, THE INCREDIBLES nearly smothered one with advertising, and it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time!  But, I was proved wrong.  As soon as the first black screen of the movie showed, my doubts and fears were alleviated.  PIXAR still has a whole lot left in them, and will for many, many years.  This movie is clever, interesting, and more and more it seems to be the kind of breather I need to get away from all of the crude humor and cheap, cruel laughs that most movies resort to nowadays.  If you want to see a good movie, just skip Over the Hedge and go watch Cars.  It's refreshing to see an animation studio making good use of animation again.

review/summary: All Revved Up!
review/text: CARS is going to be another feather in Pixar's feather-studded hat.  Insightful and delightful, the film offers up the coming-of-age of Lightning McQueen, the rookie racecar that's tearing up the tracks and hot on the trail of the magnificent Piston Cup.  However, Lightning manages to derail himself by alienating his pit crew and talking his truck transport into driving all night and getting him lost in the middle of the desert somewhere along Route 66, the highway that used to be the byway to the western United States.  But that's where the story begins.  Lightning has to make restitution for tearing up the town, and along the way he ends up making friends that enrich and give meaning to his life.  Pixar Studios is absolutely the crown jewel of the animated studios.  A lot of new faces are showing up in that market, but no one else even comes close to what Pixar can serve up.  Beginning with TOY STORY and moving through MONSTERS, INC., A BUG'S LIFE (which are lampooned in the end credits of CARS) and including the INCREDIBLES, Pixar has held unchallenged sway over animated movies.  CARS has one of the oldest plots in storytelling.  Young upstart with the world by the tail gets taught a new lesson about the real meaning of life.  Scores of movies have used that as their baseline to tell a tale.  Yet, somehow -- probably because Pixar is just filled with magic, CARS pulls off an exciting feel-good reindition of what is probably the most hackneyed of plots.  Owen Wilson stars as the voice of Lightning, Paul Newman as Doc, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Cheech Marin as Ramon, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks and Richard Petty as the King.  All of the characters were great.  The world invented in this movie, where cars with personalities exist but people don't, comes across realistically portrayed (given the circumstances -- and viewers have to wonder where little cars come from and how they got invented).  The tractor tipping sequence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot.  This movie is a must out there in the theaters.  Children and adults will have a great time.  The only thing that's going to be better will be the DVD with all the special features showing how Pixar wove their latest magic spell.

review/summary: Pixar's Seventh Heaven?
review/text: So, will this make Pixar's run of excellent films seven for seven? Undoubtably.  Early signs however were not good. Although the release date was moved from last fall to this summer (not usually a good omen) this seems to have been more a desire for the makers to 'polish the chrome' even more than it already was. With Pixar having such a strong reputation, they needn't rush out their product to compete in the now almost saturated market.  Other bad vibes came in the form of the trailers. The teaser was pretty poor, not anything like the great ones for Monsters Inc or The Incredibles (excluding visuals which were enough to get most of our motors revving). Then the first theatrical trailer seemed to pitch the film squarely at 'motor-heads' with some pretty obscure car-based references.  Of all of Pixar's films so far, this probably has the least universal appeal, at least on the face of it. I doubt whether many little girls will want to rush and see it (I may be being a little sexist here and I apologise) but this may be made up for with the amount of grown-men that will surely queue around the block.  From here on, Pixar are now part of Disney instead of partnered with them and I sincerely hope that Pixar's knowledge rubs off onto Disney's flagging animation department.

review/summary: World Premier at Lowe's Motor Speedway
review/text: Went to to World Premier of Cars last night at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, NC.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Disney/Pixar has once again produced a terrific animated film.  Race fans will love it and need to watch closely for the parallels to NASCAR.  Those of you who have been to the infield for a race at Charlotte will like the Redneck Hill reference.  The stars turned out for the premier and Disney donated $1 million dollars split between Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camps and Speedway Charities, which includes Kyle Petty's Victory Junction Camp.  The characters in this film are loveable.  Paul Newman's 1951 Hudson Hornet is a small town judge and nobody in town knows about his checkered (flag) past.  Owen Wilson lends his voice to the main character Lightning McQueen.  Fans will fall in love with him.  Bonny Hunt is wonderful as the pretty Porche, Sally befriending Lighning in his journey through Radiator Springs.  John Ratzenberger again lends his talent to another supporting character in a Disney film. Don't leave before the credits to see additional work by John.  Tony Shaloub (Mr. Monk) plays Luiggi an Italian tire store owner and Ferrari lover.  Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and Michael Schumacher also make voice appearances in the film.  If you are a race fan you will love it.  If you are not, there are enough aspects of the film not revolving around racing for you to enjoy it.  Kids will love it and parents prepare for the onslaught of marketing that will have them wanting all things cars.  I willingly purchased 2 items today for my kids as I loved this wholesome family film.  GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!  I am eagerly awaiting the soundtrack.  Brad Paisley has 2 songs in the movie.  He played 3 songs at the Premier last night.  It's loaded with good music that young and old will enjoy.

review/summary: My sons love "Dancing Cars"
review/text: This movie never disappoints my kids, who have watched it at least 100 times.  This is actually our second copy of the movie, as the first one skips in parts due to so much use and handling by little hands.  My son calls this one "The Dancing Cars" because of the "Life is a Highway" segment.  Your kids, especially boys, will not be disappointed.  If you have a choice between "Cars" and "Cars 2" I'd definitely go with this one.  While we enjoyed Cars 2, it spends a little too much time on the whole "Oil Companies Are BAD!" theme for my liking.  This one is just straight up children's entertainment with no overt agenda.

To my suprise the DVD alone was 19.99. So I looked on-line to see if I could fine a better deal and I did. Amazon had the best deal, I purchased it from my phone while still in Target. I received e-mail confirmation immediately and the DVD was in my mailbox three days later. Let's just say my son is a happy camper!

review/text: A classic movie, as most of us already know. My nearly 3 year old kept seeing Cars merchandise and began to beg to watch the movie. To date, she had only enough attention span to stick with a 20 or 30 minute cartoon, but she held out to watch this entire movie. I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)

review/text: My children love this movie and it is so nice to have a digital copy of it so they can watch it anywhere! The only complaint is that sometimes it stops right in the middle and then we have to restart it and fast forward to where we were. This might be a problem with the Bluray player that we are playing it on, but it seems to only be a problem with the amazon movies that we watch. It doesn't happen that frequently, and it hasn't happened when we watch it on a computer so I am thinking it might be a problem with the bluray playing amazon. not sure. But I will continue to buy my kids movies on amazon because it is so convenient, and again it doesn't happen that often.

review/text: I was surprised to find out that this also includes the DVD version!  The product title and description does not make this apparent, but this is a great bonus.  You can give the DVD to your kids without having to worry about the blu ray version getting lost or damaged.  The blu ray version of this is glorious, this was a movie meant to be viewed in HD. I watched this using my DLP projector which only displays 720p however the difference between the DVD version and the HD version is very noticeable even at 720p.  I didn't have time to watch all the special features, but a noteworthy one is the "Mater and the Ghostlight" short which is included on both the DVD and Blu ray disc.  Overall a great purchase.

review/summary: An incredibly beautiful animation and very touching and funny story
review/text: Both me and my 6 years old daughter we loved this movie - although of course for different reasons.  She appreciated the very idea of talking cars and then the races, Mator the "red-neck" car, etc. I was impressed by the animation - this is for the moment the most technically advanced animation movie I ever saw ("Happy Feet" did as well) - and the more adult oriented humouristic parts (a Porsche girl who left Los Angeles to find peace in a small town; an old town doctor, called Doctor in Internal Combustion; the cars going to the toilet - guess which line is advancing faster..., a rivalry between a "Peace and Love" old van and a retired sergeant who is of course a jeep, a Japanese female journalist who is a gorgeous little Honda, etc, etc.).  The final scenes in which they show fragments of older Pixar movies (like Sully and Mike Wazowski stranded in Himalayas) played by cars (the Yeti being an enormous snow tractor) are a delight. I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too. She insisted on sleeping on a pillow with Ligthning McQueen for months after that...  If you didn't see it - go and get it.

You can't buy this particular Mater anywhere, as far as I know, and it's got a very cool, metallic paint job (and isn't plastic-bodied like the ones in the stores).

review/text: I saw Cars in the theater years ago and was excited to see that it was available on Blu Ray from Amazon. I have my own children now and wanted them to experience Cars for the first time in a crisp, vivid format. This blu ray certainly delivers. From sound quality to picture quality, this dvd made us feel like we were watching the movie in the theater. I love the message behind the movie: just because you may be the "best" at something doesn't mean that you are a "winner" and Ligntning McQueen learns this lesson though a loveable and down home cast of cars and trucks. My daughter is a huge Lightning McQueen fan now - definitely not just a movie for boys!

review/summary: Cars Have Feelings Too!
review/text: Even if you don't know much about cars or NASCARs, Cars is such fabulous entertainment their is no reason not to love it from beginning to end.  Pixar, similar to Toy Story, puts heavy duty race cars in a human light -- not one character in the movie is human.  Lighting McQueen an arrogant, rookie race car is aiming to win The Piston Cup.  If he wins he'!l get a major endorsement and be one of the elite cars of all of racing!  However because of his arrogance and his lack of respect for people in the field of racing, he finds himself friendless. So happens, his life takes a dramatic turn as he is lead into a run down town by the name of Radiator Spring off Route 66.  He meets a several fellow town's cars, especially those that help impact him in a positive light as it reaches it's climax.  The amination of the film is creative and brillant use of color.  The sound is vibrant as you really feel like you are on a race track or driving down a highway.  The voices are pretty good, my favorite of course is from the late Paul Newman who plays Doc Hudson.  For what it's worth the movie is terrific!  It is definetly a family movie and Pixar once more proves their excellence in pictures by using cars to tell fun, thoughtful, and real storytelling.

review/summary: Like A Typical Race, A Pleasant "Cars" Follows A Very Routine And Expected Track
review/text: I really wanted to love "Cars" when it came out! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless and it's quite unfashionable to be critical of this movie, I had actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record prior to this film. "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," and "The Incredibles" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And "Toy Story 2" and "Monsters, Inc." are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.  But, alas, I was a bit let down with "Cars." It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no "real" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.  "Cars" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like "Life Is A Highway" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.  Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing "Cars," did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, "Cars" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06.

review/text: This isn't the type of film I'd watch on a regular basis, but I was on a plane and this was the featured movie so I tuned in. It was cute. The movie is about a truck that's friends with a race car, but another set of cars are plotting against the race car over a battle about oil. This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better. There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained. It's not the type of film I'd run out and buy, but I do think it'd be fun for kids and adults alike.

review/summary: Cool ride!
review/text: Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film. After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.  In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.  Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift). This is a great film and one that I'd rank with some of my favorite live action car films.

review/summary: My son requests this movie EVERY day!
review/text: We don't watch this every day, of course, but my five year-old son would be happy if we did.  We moved into a new, furnished house recently and put our old dvd player in storage. Unfortunately, our copy of "Cars" was in it at the time and rendered inaccessible for the moment.  I purchased this copy because we just couldn't do without it. My son asks for it every day.  Naturally I've seen it a thousand times at this point, but even though it's not my favorite Pixar film, it is still pretty great and it holds up to multiple viewings. The story is good (as is always the case with Pixar), there are lots of little extra touches (look for the VW "bugs" on the flourescent lights), and even my two year old gets excited about the race scenes.  I like that the BluRay combo has a regular DVD as well, because when we get our BluRay player out of storage, we can use that, but for now the regular DVD works too, and it means we really have three copies:  the one stuck in our old player, and these two. Considering how often we watch the film, we may need them!

review/summary: Favorite of Children. Big Ones Like It Too!
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a family with small children. I know it has been a favorite for many families. Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too. Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young. It's the kind of movie that deserves repeated watching.  I have read a number of books on leadership this year. I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N6VVFM">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions</a>], a "leadership fable" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop. These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.  You can see some of this at work in this movie. I believe you can see also the reversal of some form of these at work as the movie progresses. You see that it takes the development of interpersonal relationships and personal goals to overcome obstacles that are necessary to make teams work--to make us team players. These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire. We all want them to be successful. These are not trivialized by successful persons. A great plus is: it's all presented in an understandable format within the context of something that is simply good entertainment enjoyed by many of us.  Very enjoyable and instructional!

review/summary: Still Charming Half a Decade Later
review/text: I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's "classics" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.  In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.  In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.  While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.  The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.  NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.  Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.  In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.

review/summary: A Return to Classic Disney?
review/text: I've seen pretty much every Disney movie ever made, to include the live action and made-for-TV movies.  I grew up with them, and AM a grown-up that still loves them.  That being said, I was very disappointed with a slew of movies released by the company in the late 90's and into the early 00's.  They seemed empty, mere gimmicks for marketing and devoid of any sort of viable plot.  After seeing some of the initial reviews for this movie, I knew I had to check it out.  It was rated VERY highly, and I hoped that so many people couldn't be wrong about this movie.  This movie was incredible.  The animation is top-notch (computer animation has come a long way since Tron and The Last Starfighter). The voices are definitely on the mark for the characters.  And the plot...simplistic, but it's nice to see solid growth in the main character and a good resolution, with a little ribbing on the sourpusses of the movie.  Cars is more than just watchable...I've seen it several times, and have noticed new things going on every time.  This is definitely a positive direction for Disney, and I hope they keep it up.

review/summary: HOT ROD HEARTS
review/text: The producers of CARS will probably have to dust off their shelves to make room for the Oscar it will probably get for Best Animated movie.  CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.  There he meets a Porsche lawyer voiced by Bonnie Hunt; a towtruck named Mater which is Larry the Cable Guy; and a former racing hero named Hudson Hornet played by Paul Newman.  There are some cute moments and the animation IS brilliant, so CARS is a fun film to enjoy.

review/summary: Review: Cars
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed Pixar's latest movie and here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)  The open-ended one sentence summary: Selfish racecar gets stranded in a little Route 66 town with a towtruck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. 'Nuff said.  Content Inappropriate for All Ages: 2 mild "bad words" refering to a place, and about 5 innuendos, most involving "nuts".  Characters: 4 of 5 cars. Lots of variety in this department. Most of the characters were believable and acted accordingly, but I didn't care about them as much as I was expecting. First of all, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) was a riot. Mack the truck had an awfully familiar voice... *wink* and did a good job. The only casting choice I didn't like was Bonnie Hunt as Sally. She sounded too old for the part.  Plot: 4 of 5 cars. Starts off with a twist, falls into a pattern for a while, then ends with a twist I didn't even see coming. Comedic bits interspersed. Pretty quality stuff.  Animation: 5 of 5 cars. Animation like we've come to expect from Pixar. I'm sure it was hard to animate those cars' faces.  Music: 4 of 5 cars. The songs (not original) perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I didn't find the score memorable, though.  Impact: 3 of 5 cars. I'd say this is the most important section of the review. I did get involved in this movie when I saw it, but it wasn't a tear-jerker. The big finale didn't leave me with the sense of triumph which was essentially the whole point. I did think about this movie after I saw it, but I wasn't enamoured with it. It didn't leave me with any hard hitting thoughts on its characters, or side splitting lines to quote.  All in all, 4 of 5 cars.

review/summary: Another Disney Pixar Classic
review/text: I always find the Disney Pixar films to be a treat. And Cars is no different. The animation is incredible, with canyon landscapes, waterfalls, and highways. And with a great soundtrack, the music montages throughout the film are impeccable.  The voices are great. All too often, the names of the cast of these animated movies are much bigger than the actual voice talents. But it's great to hear the voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (who is hilarious by the way) playing around on screen.  And don't forget about the minor characters. It's great seeing stereotype cars such as the hippie van, the army jeep, the sexy Porsche, the old carriage, the German Volkswagen beetle, and many others. Though funny, it's refreshing to see that they didn't center the plot around a silly gag such as stereotyping cars, the way it was advertised.  The plot is very simple, a big shot race car learns his lesson by making friends while stuck in a remote town in the middle of nowhere. It's simple, but affective.  The only complaint I have with the film is its length. At 2 hours, it certainly seemed to drag. However, all in all, other than nitpicks, it was a heartwarming film.

review/summary: The Heartland of America.
review/text: CARS is the latest hit from animation power-house Pixar.  The story begins at the annual Piston Cup.  It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.  On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.  CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.  However, for anyone who lives in middle American or who has an interest in NASCAR or Route 66, CARS is a film that you will probably adore.  I know I do.

review/summary: My 4-year-old and 36-year-old love it!
review/text: There is a reviewer on here who says this movie is not good for younger kids. I disagree.  It really depends on your child's interests. My son was three when this movie first came out.  He had never watched a movie all the way through before, and is usually bored by videos/movies.  This is the first movie that he has shown any interest in seeing.  Long before it came out he was fascinated by the pictures of cars with faces and we took him to see the movie months ago (his first movie theatre experience) and there has not been a day since that he doesn't talk about Cars.  He knows all the characters, remembers the whole plot (we only saw it once), and now he compares the types of cars in the movie with the ones he sees on the road.  I thought I wouldn't like the movie because I am totally uninterested in cars, but I thought it was really well done.  The characterizations are fun and the animation is superb.  Only Pixar could come up with such a creative, engaging movie about cars.  My husband LOVED it and is looking forward to the DVD release as much as my four-year-old, who keeps asking for it for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and admire Pixar even more after seeing it.

review/summary: Another GREAT Pixar film.
review/text: I loved CARS, it has amazing animation, good story, even though it is a bit slow in the middle, I think the pace could have been tightened up a bit. Not as good as PIXARS best film THE INCREDIBLES. BUt I realy enjoyed this film.  So many CGI film today can't come close to story and quality of animation of a PIXAR film. Disneys first try, Chicken little fell short, just not a good complex story, not saying it isn't fun, just not good enough.  And finally, why do they continue to release movies in FOOL-SCREEN (fullscreen). It destroys the movie and what the director wanted you to see.  Do people actually realize they cut off the side of the movie to make it fit your square tv. I work for a national retailer, who's log is made of big red circles. I love when someone comes in to get a movie and it is ONLY in widescreen and they have to buy a widescreen movie. When I tell then that a 2:35 aspect ratio movie cuts off HALF the movie and I show them it on a TV. Alot of people are switching to widescreen now.  If people quit buying fullscreen they will stop making them,

review/summary: You need to stop and smell the roses
review/text: I have to say that I've seen this movie twice, and it was time well spent.  As Pixar always does, the animation was outstanding, and the story was top notch.  The kids can see all of the cool race cars, while the adults can appreciate the story about individuals who care about each other.  This movie has definitely been one of the better movies of the summer.  We need more movies to remind us that life is too short to not stop and smell the roses.  We need to appreciate those around us and what they bring to our lives.  Towards the end of the movie, when Lightning McQueen stops right before the finish line and goes to push "The King" over the finish line, the viewer can see McQueen's transformation from a selfish race car to one who realizes that he needs others on his team in order to succeed.  I wish that there were more movies out there with such a positive message and lots of humor.  It is ironic that a movie about cars can remind me of why we need other people in our lives.  Pixar does it again.  Cars hits a homerun, scores a touchdown, and wins first prize in the race.  We all need to remember to stop and smell the roses.  Seeing Cars reminded me of that very fact.

It is gorgeous--they did a wonderful job with lighting, effects, etc.  We have both the Widescreen regular version as well as this Blu Ray and it's a world of difference.  Of course, with Blu Ray, you see SO much more, but even I was surprised with how much more crisp an animated picture could be. The movie itself is cute--has a GREAT message, and of course, lots of adult humor mixed in with the kids' stuff.  Great movie for all ages.  Gotta have a Blu-Ray player--whether it be a PS3 or a separate unit, it's a must-have for any HD home. Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too!

I understand the plot about McQueen getting to be sponsored by an oil company but seriously? if the movie was good why give it one star? I really do feel sorry for people who can't watch this movie and not just enjoy it and not worry about the plot the whole time. All the main characters were well designed and the voices were well matched. I enjoyed the movie too, everything written on the score matches the situation very nicely. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone with either a 2, 3 or 4 year old child. I'm sure they'll have fun.

review/summary: Possibly Pixar's Best!
review/text: This movie could possibly be the best one Pixar has put out there.  The characters are all so cute, and cleverly thought out.  For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.  Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen because even though he's a famous actor, his lines aren't tired and bored.  It's almost like he enjoyed the filming.  Could they have picked a better person for the redneck tow truck than Larry the Cableguy?  I don't believe so.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is the tractor tipping, which I can see Larry doing.  Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).  Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.  Lightning McQueen is that spoiled superstar, who happens to find himself in the middle of nowhere.  He does some bad things to the town, and now, at his disgust, is made to spend time there and repair the damage he has caused.  Because of this, he actually learns that the the "little" people of the world can actually be pretty cool, and that just because he is a celebrity, he is not the center of the universe.

We picked it up because we both love cars, but ended up loving it for it's high quality story and well-developed characters.  It's definitely a feel good, family movie, but it has a lot to offer, especially for a car enthusiast.  The only reason we gave it 4 stars is because it forces you to buy a DVD combo if you want the blu-ray.  This seems excessive to me, and certainly a waste of a DVD.

review/summary: Perfect for the Kid Who Loves Matchbox Racers - His Parents, Less So
review/text: There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.

review/text: my son already had a copy of this movie but over time it had worn down and had many scratches. We purchased the new copy which included a dvd and blu-ray copy as well. The movie was well packaged and as stated in seller's note; brand new never used. We were very impressed with time frame in which the movie arrived, I would highly recommend this seller to all.

review/summary: Cars is worth the ride and even better in HD!!!
review/text: When it premiered in 2006, Cars was met with some lukewarm response from critics. It was positive but not as positive as previous Pixar films have been met. Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story. I've never been interested in the world of racing but when I saw Cars in theaters, I realize it was not only for racing fans. It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it. Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend. The story has really good messages and as with every Pixar film, the animation and the level of detail is simply breathtaking.  Cars may not be your cup of tea but is a worthwile picture and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one. Cars may be seen like the worst Pixar production but even worst Pixar means amazing and much much better than all the competition has to offer. Cars is an excellent film.  Video & Audio:  Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package. Now Disney has repackaged it alongside a DVD in order to promote the sequel that will premiere this summer in theaters. Cars BD is magnificent. You can watch every detail, every nuance, every texture in the screen. No compression artifacts are found in the print. Cars BD is amazing.  Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department. You can hear everything with absolute clarity.  Bonus Features:  In comparison with other Pixar BD sets, Cars is somewhat light in the bonus features department but still has a lot of insight bonus material.  First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time. This mini documentaries include design of characters, settings, graphics, animation and more.  If you prefer you can also watch this documentaries separately. You also have deleted scenes, a game, the shorts One Man's Band and Mater and the Ghostlight, the inspiration for the movie and more.  A DVD copy is also offered.  Sneak Peeks: Some trailers include:  Cars 2 (in theaters June 24) The Lion King: Diamond Edition (on BD and DVD this fall) The Incredibles on BD (already released) Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Sep. 20) The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Aug. 9)  Closing Thoughts:  Cars is an excellent film that is worth watching. With stunning video and excellent audio and many insightful bonus material this BD/DVD combo is a must-own release. Completely recommended!!!

review/summary: Nice bonus for about the same price
review/text: My 2.5yo son is a big fan of Cars (both the movie and toy cars), and when I saw this I knew he'd love it. No complaints coming from the little guy, but there's something about the metallic paint of these vehicles that don't seem to have the same quality as the typical "Cars" cars you find in stores.  Not sure if it was due to a limited production run, or simply due to contaminates in the air/paint.  Not an issue for young kids, but may be a concern for some collectors. It looks like each car might come out a little different, dust in the paint, etc..  Very happy with the purchase, and love watching the movie in Blu-Ray. Would definitely recommend to other fans.

review/summary: Tremendous Buy Especially From The Disney BluRay Club
review/text: My situation is a bit different from the other reviews.  Several weeks ago, I joined the Disney Blu-Ray Movie Club. I received eight (8) very popular (ie: UP, Cars 1&2, etc) Disney BD's.  Of course the rub is that I must purchase three (3) BD's at the $31.95 price. My first purchase was $19.17 for the CARS BD Combo Gift Set, the BD Prince of Persia at $31.95, and Pirates 3 BD at $13.00.  The total for everything was $60.12 including shipping and no tax.   My two grand kids couldn't wait to play with Mater & McQueen and watch Cars over & over & over.  I don't know why some folks think the cars are a cheap knock-off but the one I received are still holding up. I'm sure if you want to hold on to it, it will go up in value.  But, please, don't take my word on that!

review/summary: One of the best ever
review/text: This is one of the best kid movies I've seen.  It's so good, that viewing it can actually be tolerated by adults repeatedly! Our picks in movies have to be attitude-minimum, since my little one picks up on it and imitates.  The 'tude in "Cars" characters is shown to be unacceptable behavior to other characters.  The soundtrack is well-done, featuring a nice array of old, and remade and new songs.  It's also free of sing-song tunes, which grate the nerves if you happen to want to watch movies with your children or just be in the same house while they watch!  My only negative comment is that Lightning yells "hillbilly hell" once and I don't want my child repeating that.

review/summary: "Speed, I am Speed!" Blu ray review
review/text: Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a hot shot rookie race car on the Piston Cup circuit! On his way to winning it all, he ignores the advice of his pit crew and blows his tires near the finish line. A photo-finish shows a 3-way tie and sets the stage for the big race. A wrong turn on his way to California lands him in hot water at Radiator Springs. Sentenced to fix the road he destroyed in this old and dilapidated town something happens. The self-centered racing stud starts to care about something more than himself.  This a great movie for kids and adults. The story is wonderful as are the lessons to be learned. I am extremely partial to this film because it was my little boy's 1st favorite movie! Disney/Pixar do it again!  NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: DAZZLING! The details on Blu-Ray are outageous. The picture is tremendous, the reflections and details on the cars are amazing! The sound wasn't what I expected but was fine. All the special features are carried over to HD and their are additional Blu-Ray features added! FINAL VERDICT: DON'T LOSE THIS RACE! UPGRADE, ABSOLUTELY! BUY IT!

review/summary: Inspirational
review/text: Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called "The King" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI">Rocky IV</a>, which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!

The only thing is that I would like it to have Spanish track (Disney does this very often), however that is my mistake because I did not read carefully the specs.

review/summary: Last of the Conventional Pixar
review/text: Pixar has always been a great movies.  Cars is no exception.  However, in terms of movie history, Cars was the last of the traditional Pixar.  Since then the stories have been more unconventional, following a rat who wants to cook, a robot love story, and a man who moves his house with balloons.  So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).  Also, I appreciate the basis of the story, the lost world of Route 66, where people cared about there stop, rather than drove past only stopping for gas.  In short, the movie is a resounding success that should be seen. Also, the blu-ray is gorgeous.  It is demo quality, seeing the reflections off every car, every detail in the ground, and you really feel the speed during the races.  Overall, Cars is a great movie, that looks amazing.  Recommended for fans of fun movies for a younger audience.

review/summary: Cars on blu-ray Rocks!
review/text: Cars is the first movie I ever bought on Blu-Ray about a year or 2 ago.  It does not disappoint.  Amazing picture, the details are just jaw dropping. The movie itself has a good story and it is fun.  I still watch it from time to time even though I have no children and I am almost 50 years old.  I love the soundtrack too.

review/text: This review is short and sweet. What a wonderful movie for anyone of any age! It presents values without preaching, it has humor, and it aptly displays a nostalgia for days when driving the highways of America was an experience, not merely a means of getting from here to there as fast as one can. Thanks to this movie, I try to find stretches of road that evoke Americana when I travel. It doesn't hurt to venture more than a mile off the interstate. In fact, it's quite pleasant. And "Cars" reminds us of that.

review/summary: Is it suicide to critique a popular animated movie?
review/text: Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.  As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 "Mother Road" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.  Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.  There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)  And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the "whore with a heart of gold." Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.  This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.

review/text: This is a case of an animated feature which crosses age boundaries. On the surface it's a story of a race car suddenly out of his element.  It goes deeper to show how we all sometimes must face situations out of our comfort zone in order to discover our true priorities. The color, clarity and overall quality were nothing less than would be expected of Disney/Pixar.

review/summary: Get Your Kicks Watching Cars on Route 66!
review/text: Owen Wilson's friendly voice as race car "Lightning McQueen" is perfect for the Pixar movie about all kinds of cars.  The animation is outstanding as usual.  The mega-truckstop at the beginning of the movie showed a perfect example of the fantastic art and culture of the road.  "Cars" frames the 'road of life' and lessons old and young souls understand.  Kids will especially enjoy the racing and action scenes.  Lightning is in a hurry to get to California for a big race and is traveling cross-country in a semi-truck. A series of accidents happen and Lightning McQueen ends up in a small desert town of Radiator Springs.  It is full of dying businesses because the traffic they depend on has been diverted to a new, faster Interstate.  When the old Route 66 went through, Desert Springs was doing well.  Lightning is arrested for tearing up the road and put in a "boot" and impounded.  The rusty old Tow Truck (Mato - short for To-Mato) is voiced over by Larry the Cable Guy.  Mato is friendly, dopey and kind to Lightning.  Lightning only wants to get back to his fast-paced world.  The story is somewhat nostalgic for times that were not as pressured.  The reference to Route 66 following the bends and the lay of the land reminds us we need to take time to stop and smell the roses.  Now we have interstates cutting through in straight lines to save a few minutes here and there.  The story flows well and moves fast.  It is a thoughtful, creative movie and highly amusing.  All the car characters are well developed and personalities match their make and models.  We have diversity and idiosyncrasy in the mix. There is the romance of the road as well as Lightning McQueen's romance with a sweet and racy Porsche lawyer (Bonnie Hunt).

review/summary: Get it on Blu-ray
review/text: Short: Get it on Blu-ray, well worth it and priced right.  Story (4/5): I always supported Pixar and their movies because they were all about the story telling and creating an epic environment.  They usually avoided all the off-topic jokes and pop culture references that you'll typically see in most animated family movies.  Cars crossed that line a bit, but the story telling is still there.  It seems unique and typical at the same time, which makes no sense, but that is how it feels.  I can't say more than that without spoiling the movie.  Visuals (5/5): While watching the film, I kept saying in my head, "Man, that must've been expensive to make."  It looks amazing and detailed, and they didn't blur out distance details to say time and money.  Moreover, without the human features, the cars would be hard to distinguish from the real thing.  So this is a must buy for Blu-ray people.  One should also consider upgrading their entertainment center for Pixar movies in general, or you'll be missing out.  Characters and Voicing (5/5): Another great thing about Pixar films is that they cast people that fit the roles they're voicing.  No random popular celebrity for marketing purposes.  Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (to name a few) all did great jobs voicing his/her character.  The characters (with car type matching their personality) are very interesting across the board.

review/text: I don't think Pixar has gone wrong yet, and that is certainly true with "Cars."  Lightning McQueen is on the fast-track to being a big star (literally, he's a race car).  However, after finding himself stranded in run-down little Radiator Springs--a once-prosperous old Route 66 town that fell off the map when the Interstate bypassed it--he realizes the importance of slowing down, and how much it matters to care for others.

review/text: This is sort of like a pixar version of Doc Hollywood, it's the classic juxisposition of urban vs. rural and modern vs. vintage, with the requisite odd couple love triangle thrown in for good measure.  The digital animation is, of course first rate and the story has a nice message. I especially appreciated Newman's voice, his is the perfect voice for this character.  Look, I must confess, I cant stand Owen Wilson, his naisal voice and that bizarre nose, I mean what actress could have a career like he has had if she had a nose like that, I mean, right..but since I didnt not have to look at him, I actually liked his take on the main character, and Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the old Redneck tow truck, as for the Porsche, I really didnt like Bonnie Hunt, her voice is too old, she is like well into her forties, they needed a Jennifer Anniston or Angie Jolie to voice that character, they are more Wilson's age, in all due respect, Hunt's voice was for like an 80's Accord, but whatever..cute movie, great vivid dig animation, kids will love it`

My daughters 3 and 5 have been squabbling about being first out the door, in the door, etc.  But, my older one really understood after watching Cars that that isn't nice.  She realized that it isn't nice when she and her sister act like the green car in the movie.  It was a great way to start talking to her about why it isn't nice to always be first or to push someone out of the way!

The animation is amazing on Blue Ray; in some of the scenes, the cars actually look real. And there are so many little details that went into this movie that make it really special, like how the engine noises of the different types of cars are accurate (like the purr of the Porsche). My favorite scenes are Guido's 3 second pit stop, and the tractor tipping scene (I crack up every time Mater says, "That's Frank!")  This is a fun movie to watch, even if you're not a racing fan. And I think this is a cute movie for kids of all ages. Every day when we come home, our son says, "Mama, wace car, wace car!"

review/summary: Cars on Blu-Ray : A True Blu-Ray Demonstration Disc!
review/text: This is a must have for your collection. I don't even like this movie that much. I think it's one of Pixar's weaker films. Of course Pixar is always good quality entertainment, so even a weaker film by their standards is better than all that unwatchable CGI nonsense from other companies. We can talk about the cliched storyline of the arrogant city slicker driving into an old, beat up town populated with goofy characters all day. It wouldn't matter. The movie is a total cliche, he learns his lessons about life and not being selfish, he wins the affection of the "girl car", he inspires the old champion racer to reconnect with the world again, his goofy sidekicks rebuild their town and get back to grooving, whatever... It's not a great story.  The story and characters are second rate but the visual quality of this movie on Blu-Ray will make your jaw drop! I watched Ratatouille on Blu-Ray first and was mightily impressed but I knew Cars would take the cake as a demonstration disc on account of Cars being very colorful. It exceeded my expectations.  Watch the scene when the main character "Lighting McQueen" gets into that transport truck and they drive out of the stadium and across the freeway of the city at night and then across the highways of the Southwest in the day. "Life is a Highway" is the musical cue during this scene. The visual scheme is gorgeous, lifelike, 3-Dimensional with an extreme sense of depth perception. It looks like real life even though it's a CGI animated film!  I watched Cars using a PS3 connected via a standard HDMI cable to a 42 inch, 1080p LCD TV by LG. Every person who has seen this kind of quality has been very delighted as the reviews here demonstrate and so will you! WALL-E is going to look drop dead gorgeous when it comes out. I saw WALL-E at the movie theater, on a massive screen with digital projection. It looked great. It will be eye poppingly awesome on Blu-Ray too. Until then, you've got Cars and Ratatouille. Enjoy!

review/summary: Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf.
review/text: I feel forced to write about seeing "Cars" for the first time in Blu-ray.  I have a five-year old named Benicio. "Cars" was his first experience in a real movie theater. On DVD, he used to watch it several times a day; it was basically background to his daily activities running around playing at home. He knows the movie intimately, and since he knows how to use the remotes, actually maneuvers around the film at will.  Well, I was recuperating from surgery, and I plopped this disc into my new Blu-ray player the afternoon after my hernia repair. Ben plopped down right next to me, seeing the disc case, asking, "Are you going to watch "Cars"? Can I watch it with you?"  The movie loaded and unspooled, and you would have thought he had never seen it before. Was it the three-dimensional, hypnotizing, hyper-real images? Was it the completely enveloping audio mix? Who knows? But let me tell you WHATEVER it was, it worked magic on my little guy. He got back into the movie as if it was a totally new experience.  Now as a father who probably could lip-synch the movie if pressed, I have to tell you the same exact thing happened to me. I was lost in this "Cars" world. The picture was crystalline; the audio pure.  What an extraordinary experience for a film buff! I felt a true sense of rediscovery. Details, in-jokes, audio subtleties..."Freebird" indeed.  Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf.

review/summary: "Doc Hollywood" for Cars
review/text: It's funny. I am late coming to this movie because I was afraid it would be too intense for my child, who just turned 3. I have yet to let him watch Nemo. Also, I am doing everything I can to discourage NASCAR viewer ship in my household. (Being a Southerner, you choose between two classes - Thoroughbreds or stock cars.)  At last, I gave in. My son loves the cars and although he had not asked for the movie, my partner and I needed a break from Thomas, so I bought the widescreen version of this movie.  The first thing I realized was that this is the same story as Doc Hollywood. Now, I happen to be a sap and I loved Doc Hollywood, but I was afraid it might be a too-familiar theme to keep my interest. Suffice it to say, I did not pause the movie one time from start to end.  Some say it does not have enough drama, but I am so glad no one has to die in this one, especially the Mom - and in a very loud and violent way - such as with Nemo. (I am still wondering whether Walt Disney ever got therapy for his Mother issues. Between the Mothers dying and the rest of the older women being witches - well...)  The characters are amazingly well-developed, remarkably loveable and incredibly designed. The casting was perfect and the tons of little jokes and spoofs will keep us watching this for a long time - if for nothing else than to watch for the jokes we missed.  We may have enjoyed it more than he did, but I know he will watch it many times in the months to come.  Oh - and for those who didn't have at least one little tear - cut back on your Prozac.

The "speed" and "lightening" and even the classic music used in the film (Route 66 and the first song I heard right after getting my driver's license at 16 - Life is a Highway) make the perfect blend for a life-long HIT!  The actual story is original - tying racing with the story of Route 66.  The characters are likable and entertaining for ALL ages!  Whether you are 3 or 103, I think you will enjoy the originality, comedy, music, action and even a little bit of romance!  Two thumbs up and a must- have for all animation film collectors!

review/text: Just watched this film, and loved it! Another hit from Pixar! Beautiful PQ from beginning to end, and the storyline is touching throughtout. Even as a an adult with no kids, I thoroughly enjoyed this film-a great blend of humor, humanity, romance, and a fitting use of lyrics.

review/text: When this movie came out and I read the reviews they all seemed to be pretty negative - saying that a car wasn't warm and fuzzy it was cold and sterile - things like that - so I wasn't really interested in seeing it but I can't tell you how wrong those reviews were.

review/summary: Good movie, better audio, top ten surround sound movie of all time.
review/text: This movie is my kid's favorites.  My wife and I enjoy the story and audio production.  The opening scene is one of the best tests for a theater system.  Even though it is a cartoon, it sounds like you're running around the track with the cars.  When I want to demonstrate my surround sound system to my friends I do not feel ashamed to pop in a kid's movie.  The audio was put together great care and it shows.

review/summary: Isn't this the same plot as "Doc Hollywood"?
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305133468">Doc Hollywood</a> Don't get me wrong - I loved the movie!  Animation was great, characters were lovable, etc.  I just couldn't help thinking that it was a re-vamped version of "Doc Hollywood".  In "Doc Hollywood", the big-shot doctor(Michael J. Fox) on his way to Beverly Hills to be a plastic surgeon and has a car accident which destroys a fence in a tiny little town in the middle of nowhere.  He's stuck in this town while his Porche is being fixed, and to make up for the damage to the fence, he must help out the town's only physician (an aging guy about to retire) as community service.  In short, he ends up falling in love with the town, the townspeople, and a certain lady.  He ends up going to Beverly Hills to do the plastic surgeon thing, but ultimately misses the town and the girl so much, that he returns to be the town's physician.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, that's what I thought too.

review/summary: Very good but not up to Pixar's other greats!
review/text: In a world where cars rule, celebrity race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) had a swanky lifestyle of fortune and glory until one uneven night when he's on his way to the major race coming soon in California, Lightning gets left behind accidently. He's left stranded in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs on Route 66 where he accidently damages the town's road as he's forced by the locals to fix it, during his stay he befriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt), former race car champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), redneck truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and  Ramone (Cheech Marin) as he really wants to get to the race until he realizes that he has to help the poor unfortunite town back to it's original glory.  Very entertaining and sometimes funny yet witty Pixar Cgi animated comedy is well done but no where on the quality as Pixar's other movies like "Toy Story 1 & 2", "Monsters Inc.", "Incredibles", "Finding Nemo" and the highly underrated "A Bug's Life". Sure it's got a great cast especially Michael Keaton as Lightning's rival Chick Hick with George Carlin and splendid CGI animation, but it's not quite original like the other works of Pixar cause this movie will remind viewers of the Michael J. Fox movie "Doc Hollywood" with it's similar plot. But luckily this year's "Rataoullie" was a vast improvement on this movie, but i believe "Happy Feet" with the highly underrated "Monster House" did much better then this movie back in 2006 when it comes to unique CGI animated movies.  This DVD contains a load of cool extras like two short films, a featurette on how they made the movie and deleted scenes, it is very good but thankfully "Ratatoulie" was better.

review/summary: Excellent Movie
review/text: Cars on Blu-Ray is really an excellent buy for anyone that likes Pixar flicks. I always enjoyed the movie itself, and when it became available on Blu-Ray, I had to buy it. I have not tried the extras yet, but the movie itself is flawless - I should mention I have the PS3 as playback device.

My Thoughts: Really cute story about true friendship, keeping your word and doing the right thing. My preschool son loves this movie. He is always asking to watch it. We've seen it dozens of times and it never gets old. My husband who never likes animated films enjoys CARS. Sure to be a Disney classic.

review/summary: A Fun Family Film--From the Small Town to the Big Track!
review/text: I took my kid (age 6) to see "Cars" last week, not really knowing what to expect.  I've never been into racing, but was attracted by the concept (anyone else remember the shortlived cartoon "Wheelie"?).  Both of us were able to connect with the humor right away, which like the diverse characters in this film spans several generations.  The concept of a world populated entirely by inanimate vehicles (mostly cars, but a tractor or train here and there) is a relatively original one on the big screen, and the studio must have had a lot of fun with this one.  Character development was terrific--just as each make and model of vehicle has its own technical characteristics in real life, each personality in "Cars" has its own talents and quirks.  The plot revolves around rookie racer Lightning McQueen, who is part of a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup, and must cross the country to Los Angeles where there will be a tie-breaker between himself, dependable veteran The King, and perpetual second-placer Chick Hicks.  Along the road to Los Angeles, Lightning McQueen's selfishness is the cause of an unintended detour to a little town called Radiator Springs.  Radiatior Springs is a nifty village on route 66 complete with chrome and neon styling that the new interstate left off the map years ago.  Characters include the older and wiser Doc Hudson (Hornet), who has a secret past and manages to mentor Lighting McQueen and teach him a thing or two.  Sally is a Porsche who left fast-paced Los Angeles to settle down in Radiator Springs and open a Motel. 'Mater is the town's friendly (if rusty) towtruck with a true sense of country humor.  Flo runs the service station, Ramon the Paint and Detail shop (always with a new coat!), Luigi the tire store...There really is something for everyone, including a running humorous dialogue between "Sarge", an Army-regulation olive drab AMC Jeep who runs the local military surplus shop, and Fillmore, a '60's VW Bus with a psychadelic paint job.  I'm not going to give away too much detail, I don't want to spoil the experience for fellow viewers.  My kid loved this film and understood the humor.  There were a lot of laugh out loud moments for the both of us.  As a parent, I liked the lessons "Cars" taught about ethics, hard work, respect, kindness, keeping your word, and the importance of friendship.  Not to mention appreciating things that aren't necessarily brand new or in the fast lane!  A cute movie, fun for the whole family, a reminder that the best things in life are sometimes hidden off the main thoroughfare.  Oh, and hang around past the credits--you WILL be rewarded with the punch line for an earlier gag!

review/summary: Pixar raised the bar once again. Go see Cars!
review/text: The Bottom Line: Go see CARS!!! Pixar gathered all of the best parts of any its films and jammed them into one great film with the best animation, memorable characters, non-stop action, and heart that defines Pixar films. Go see CARS!!!  I will admit it. I think I am THE world's greatest Pixar fan. I grew up with Pixar. Pixar fostered my early childhood all the way to my teenage years. I know everything about Pixar. Some would even call me obsessed. From each short, to the inside jokes, and to all of the great characters; I've memorized all the best one liners to all of Pixar's films. I've watched each one of the films a million times. I am the best!  Which is exactly what Lightning McQueen, the racecar who thinks he's all that, thinks. After he races in the huge Piston Cup race, but ends up in a three-way tie, Lightning McQueen believes that he will win that Piston Cup. But like all great films, he confronts a problem, getting lost in the town of Radiator Springs and slowly realizing that the Piston Cup is only "an empty cup."  It is at Radiator Springs where Lightning learns the importance that it's not about the prize at the end, but the journey that one takes to get to the prize. Cars is a movie about how Route 66 was almost forgotten by the construction of the interstate. It's about knowing that judging others is not the best thing. It's about how people can get away from the rush of city life and enjoy the small town life. Best of all, it is a movie that everybody can enjoy.  The audience cried, they cheered, and they laughed for the characters on screen, because they cared for these characters. At two hours long, Cars is the longest Pixar film so far, but that's too short. Because Cars spends about a quarter of the movie developing the characters, some may say that the film almost stops and doesn't get anywhere, until it speeds up again. Lightning must fix the road that he broke. Along the way, he goes tractor tipping with Mater the tow truck, cruising with Sally the porshe, and competing with Doc Hudson the Hudson Hornet. During the "Our Town" sequence, I could feel a tear down my cheek and the Pixar folks tugged at my heartstrings. The finale sequence is probably the best finale sequence that Pixar has ever made. Each character introduced has a purpose in the film, and doesn't exist just as an ensemble.  On top of the excellent story, Cars has the best animation, traditional or computer generated, that Pixar films are known for. The vistas look surprisingly real and detailed, especially on the big screen. The reflections, the lighting, and the shading in the characters make the characters realistically stand out from the background. The filmmakers did an excellent job visually making the viewers believe that these cars are living and breathing, having human-like qualities. Each shot of the film is a piece of art, with so much happening on the screen at one point at a time that one only wonders how Pixar did it.  Since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, Pixar put one instant classic after another, creating and living up to the standard for the future of classic films. And guess what? Pixar has done it again. As a piece of fast-speed and high-quality entertainment, Pixar's Cars is the best fun you'll have all year. You're in for one hell of a ride.  (Here's a little secret for you: Look out for all of the Pixar inside jokes scattered throughout the movie. There's the jackalope from "Boundin'" on a trailer, the birds from "For The Birds" on a telephone pole, the Pizza Planet Truck behind the announcers, and if you stay to the very, very end of the credits, you'll get a surprise from the Pixar folks.)

review/summary: Don't Fall for the Negative Reviews, It Was Great!
review/text: This was a great movie.  The animation was top notch, both adults and children can be entertained by this film, and despite what some neysayers will tell you....there IS a story line.  Apparently the people that feel there is no story line couldn't grasp the simple message of "take life slow and enjoy".  The town of Radiator Springs used to be a hustle and bustle town.  But then a major freeway was opened up, which bypassed the town, saving commuters a mere 10 minutes.  We learned our lesson on our last road trip, we got off the main highway and took some alternate route, which lead us through small towns that we never saw from the main road.  And as for the length and whatnot, MY 2 YEAR OLD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!  He just sat there and watched the screen through the entire 90 some minute flick.  If an 8 year old can't sit through this, then maybe their parents should limit their sugar intake and video games in hopes to regain their attention span.  Overall, this is a GREAT movie.  Well put together, great messages behind it, lessons to be learned, and it is entertaining.  So don't listen to the negative comments because chances are, the neysayers have the attention span of a goldfish and couldn't understand the simple messages in the lessons Lightning McQueen learned: take life slow and enjoy, and that sometimes you need to think about others rather than yourself.

review/text: We just bought the Cars soundtrack as well.  My kids love the music on this movie.  This is so cute..although I will say you will hear the words idiot and shut up (which I don't agree with in kids movie's but I've heard worse).  Other than that my kids love this movie - and they are girls 5 and 2.

review/text: This was a fun animated movie about Lightning, a young rookie in the Piston Cup series.  But the fun part of the movie, Lightning is not a driver, he's a car. This movie is based in a world of living cars.  Follow the arrigant rookie that can "do it solo" to a person that really learns what the meaning of Team is.  Funny and Quirky, just the right amount.  About half way through, I remembered the movie Doc Hollywood.  The story is similar, but unique and entertaining. Things are usually funner when animated. A good one for the collection.

review/summary: Good Lessons For All Ages
review/text: We have taken our two boys, ages 5 and three, to see this movie a total of four times in various theaters since its release. I personally have never paid money to see any movie more than once in the theater, especially now when movies are released so soon onto DVD. We all loved it and can't wait for the DVD. My five year old is just beginning to play team sports and really got the "winning isn't the most important thing" concept and we have referred to it often. My three year old had never made it past the first hour of other Curious George and Ice Age 2 type movies which resort to simple slapstick comedy. He not only made it completey through Cars, which is longer than most animation movies, but sat through the touching and funny credits at the end. I used to live in the Southwest so I really enjoyed the scenery, which was amazingly accurate, and now we have committed to taking one of our first family road trips along Route 66. Maybe we'll buy this amazing soundtrack for the trip?

I borrowed this one from my local video rental service and was quite pleased with the total value and extra materials on this one.  A nice story about not "burning your bridges" as our hero did at the beginnig of the story.  But by the end he learns his lesson, and comes out on top.  Nice little story about Route 66 as well.  Kind of makes me want o rent an RV, and drive down Route 66.  Where were all the people?  MC White said:  Well, a'iiiight!

review/summary: Crowd pleaser
review/text: All right. I wanted to see the characterizations by Car Talk stars, Tom and Ray, a.k.a. Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. The Car Talk comedians make a brief, not-so-funny appearance in the first scenes. Still, I, my 14-year-old son and his aunt came away happy, despite the predictable and corny story line.  At the grand opening event, rookie racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) vies for the coveted Piston Cup against incumbent champion, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), who is determined to best his perennial second-place, at all costs. The rookie, naturally full of himself, expects to step from peddling Rusteze into big league Dynaco sponsorship. But the three tie for first place, and a tie-breaker is scheduled in California. Lightning immediately sets off, aboard his faithful truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). En route, Mack's back panel accidentally opens and the sleeping Lightning falls out on the dark interstate, where he is awakened by the roar of oncoming traffic.  Frantic to find Mack, Lightning chases the wrong truck off the interstate and winds up on Route 66 in Radiator Springs. That's where the fun starts. Race cars have no lights, and Lightning drives blindly, tearing up the road as he goes.  In court, mechanic, judge and 1951 Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) are inclined (the last, for secret reasons) to let Lightning go, but local attorney Sally (Bonnie Hunt) pressures the judge to make him repair the road he has destroyed. During his days at work, Lightning is befriended by Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and eventually by all the other town characters as well, including Sally, Sheriff (Michael Wallis), tire store owner Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and his sidekick Guido (Guido Quaroni), a retired army jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley), a shabby VW bus, Fillmore (George Carlin)--and even the Doc, whose historical racing championships Lightning discovers and advertises.  There are plenty of twists and turns in this albeit predictable road, but the end result is an instant classic, filled with great Randy Newman music, terrific scenery and some wonderful lessons about friends, community and the importance of keeping things in perspective.  We loved it, cliches and all.  --Alyssa A. Lappen

review/text: Pixar usually makes children's films that also appeal to adults on many levels, including jokes that fly well above the heads of youngsters. My son, who is three, loves to watch the first ten minutes of "Cars." Then he gets extremely bored and stops watching. Good films, such as "Finding Nemo," "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" and "Toy Story," will hold his attention for the duration. (He knows "Finding Nemo" from start to finish and has watched it, at minimum, fifty times.)  I also enjoy good children's movies (I know most of the lines from "Finding Nemo"), yet I find this film tedious. At a runtime of nearly two hours, I cannot sit through the entire movie in one sitting and even then have a difficult time watching all of it. It starts out well enough and the ending, with its positive messages of friendship, loyalty and good sportsmanship, is quite good. Much of the material in between, however, is fairly weak. Scenes drag on far too long and are just plain dull. The messages could have been conveyed in fewer and more truncated scenes and still have been as effective. The basis for a very good film here is certainly evident. As usual, Pixar's animation is excellent and the tone is just right for kids: simple without being condescending and with very sparse scatological humor (which is an astonishing feat, given Larry the Cable Guy's involvement). The voice acting is well cast and features uniformly fine performances. With more judicious writing and editing, "Cars" could have been another Pixar classic. (2.5/5 stars)

review/text: Before seeing this movie, and after, I am not a NASCAR fan.  But, this movie is done in such a way that those who even hate race car stuff can enjoy.  Like most Pixar flicks, this one has a mix of action/adventure, suspense, drama, comedy and family fun, with some adult innuendo that the kids don't notice.  Looking at how Pixar has evolved over the years, this is by far the best yet.

This movie is about a car who is selfish and through a life changing expericence with a small town, who changes into a good car.  Great detail to everything in this film, down to every little tire mark on the roads and to the trip to california when you see different landmarks in different states.  Nicole M*

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I look forward to the new Pixar movie every year, and there is good reason for that. They keep pumping out clean entertainment, and "Cars" is no different.  I found "Cars" to be quite different in its approach, as it kind of spoofs Nascar but glorifies it at the same time. I am not a Nascar fan, but I found this to be a truly funny movie. Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar. If you happen to like both--this movie is a bonus for you!  The movie pulls all the right strings by being genuinely funny, teaching moral lessons, being romantic, and being melodramatic all at the same time. From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.  The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too. There are a large number of "cameo" appearances as well, and that just adds to the fun. Nothing like trying to play "spot the star" with a cartoon full of cars!!  All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the previous Pixar films you will enjoy this, and if you've never seen another Pixar movie--now's a good time to start!

review/summary: Good but not great compared to the Pixar classics.
review/text: I liked CARS I really did like it but it lacks the magic of TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed.  I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels.  The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the "mother road" in the minds of  younger generations.  Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about  cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents.  The characterizations of vehicles living in "Radiator Springs" were clever but came from central casting.  The most original element of "Cars" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about.  In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the "planes" leave car tracks in the sky.

Children will want to watch it over and over, I think, but for me once was enough.

review/text: I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, and I confess that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ended up watching it start to finish after my son went to sleep the day after Christmas.  From the visuals to the soundtrack, an outstanding movie.  The storyline revolves around the redemption of a self-absorbed race car as he gets stuck in the town of Radiator Springs.  While serving a community service sentence for speeding, he finds love and happiness amongst a cast of unlikely characters.  I'd rank this up there with Toy Story.

I've seen all of the Disney Pixar movies, and this is my second favorite, behind the original Toy Story, but above The Incredibles. I wasn't a huge fan of Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, or Finding Nemo. If you liked the same movies that I did, then you will like this one too.

Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.  A tale of Love, Friendship, Loyalty, betrayal, and trust.  It has it all.  For the kids, yes... no worse than what bugs bunny used to have in it.  Buy this, You will like it!!!!

review/summary: Cars (3.5 stars)
review/text: The seventh film from the incredible collaboration between Disney and Pixar, Cars is probably the most mixed and formulaic movie of the bunch. That's not to say the movie isn't good. The premise, a world populated with anthropomorphic cars &agrave; la every single Disney movie ever, is admittedly prosaic but Lasseter and co. know how to milk that formula like nobody else. Cars serves as further proof of this as the film has got it where it really counts. Though the characters and the coming-of-age tale are about as traditional as it gets, Pixar again picks the perfect talents to breathe life into their CG creations. Everyone is appropriately charismatic, tough, melancholy, or goofy with Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy leading the way. Visually, Cars is absolutely stunning, topping all of Pixar's previous efforts. Sometimes the gorgeous vistas are almost too good; one can easily find themself admiring the scenery instead of paying attention to the story but the quick pace manages to reel the film's audience back in quickly enough. The only quality of Cars that is worthy of being deemed "bad" is the soundtrack; no matter how hand-in-hand country and Nascar go, bad music is still bad music (which would have been easily fixed if only Randy Newman sang the tunes). While not as revolutionary as Toy Story, heart-warming as Finding Nemo, or brilliant as The Incredibles, Cars manages to generate enough smiles and heart-felt moments to allow it a place on the shelf next to the rest of the Disney/Pixar gems.

review/summary: Finally got around to seeing it.
review/text: I admit that I avoided it in the theatre.  Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.  While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.  As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).  Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.  There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.  Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.  The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.  There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!  There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.  There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.  He takes you on a trip on Route 66 and you can see where stuff came from in the movie!  You even get to meet the real life Mater!  I am happy with this purchase and I HOPE Disney leaves them alone!

review/summary: A reason to buy Blu-ray!
review/text: I thought I would address the question that bothered me most, is it worth rebuying Cars in Blu-ray?  I ran my dvd version, side by side with my Blu-ray, alternating scene by scene, on a Visio HD 1080p 42 inch monitor.  I even upscaled the dvd to 1080p on a fine upscaling Phillips dvd player.  The whole family commented on the difference.  The complete picture was just sharper with much more detail visible.  For example, in the racing scenes you could actually make out the cars in the seats in the speedway!  The desert landscape detail was just fantastic all the way out to the horizon.  I was sceptical.  I had resisted buying any animation on Blu-ray, but I thought I would give one a try.  As far as Cars is concerned, anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not sure Blu-ray is worth the list price, but if you can get it at a substantial discount (like at Amazon), I would say you won't be disappointed.

The screams and squeels of approval tell it all. I am guaranteed a few moments to cook or pay bills or pretty much get any really pressing thing done. There is one seen that bothers me though it is when the car tries to 'out run' a train! Ok, the car makes it unharmed, still, this I HAD to explain that he(and or the car) should NEVER do that in real life! We live not too far from the REAL rail road tracks ourselves. I guess my child got the message cause the other day he was sreaming "no don't do it" to the car on the movie "your gonna get sqashed!". Over all it is a good movie to see. Funny though, I don't think he has over seen the end of it, he ussually falls asleep before it is over. Me I have to chukle, tractor tipping... please... and Frank oh boy that's just to funny...

review/text: First off, I didn't care for the movie the first time I saw it.  I'm not much of an Owen Wilson fan, and I would never watch NASCAR.  However, this is my sons favorite movie.  So, after watching it more than 200 times (I wish I were exaggerating), I can honestly say I love the movie and feel it's one of the best to date.  The movie has a number of memorable characters too.  There is so much detail in the movie, it's fun for my wife and I to pick it out.  Like the automobile fenders and wheel wells that make up the mountain ranges.  The lost couple that come into town looking for directions to the interstate, their names being "Mini" and "Van" (they are minivans).  How passing planes leave tire tracks in the sky.  These are only a few among many.  Also, after watching it in HD, you won't want to watch it in low def again.  The detail is excellent.  The overall plot is predictable, but still entertaining, and offers typical Disney/Pixar moral values.  Highly recommended for all age groups.

review/summary: How A CARtoon can make a grown man shed tears.
review/text: I had avoided seeing this movie for some time.  Although I love Pixar cartoons, this one just never did anything for me.  Leave it to Pixar to surprise and delight.  Having just turned 40 the movie resonated within me in a deeper way.  Whether it was the fact that Radiator Springs had been seemingly left behind in the modern world, or the story of how Doc Hudson had grown old and forgetten, the theme of the passage of time really struck a chord.  When lighting McQueen learns to forego winning in order to help the King finish the race, it is a moral and empathic moment for children of all ages.  I don't collect DVD's personally, only for the kids, but this is one of the few that I might consider purchasing and stashing away to enjoy privately in a quiet moment.  Highly Recommended!  Cheers!

Great voice acting. A touching story. Great for kids and adults. One of the best animated films out there. Go buy!!!

review/summary: Terrific on All Levels, Including Blu-ray Transfer
review/text: This is one of those Pixar flicks that does a better job of character development than 90 percent of the real-people films being released today.  Bugs' Life comes to mind as another positive example. It's a Disney production that even an adult can watch over and over.  I've gotten into it enough that I'm urging my family to consider a vacation out west driving Route 66.  They said that when talkies replaced silent films, several years went by before they recovered from showcasing non-stop voice chatter and got back to real artistry in film making.  It's ironic that in this day when production houses (and audiences) can't seem to get past the gee-whiz of special effects, we need a pure animated piece to take us back to the real human-quality magic that movies can deliver.  And then there's the Blu-ray video quality.  Holy crap!  This thing is knock-your-socks-off.  Animated films have an advantage in that everything can be simultaneously in focus.  Shadowy details can have a little contrast and sharpness added, and so-on.  The sound effects can be optimally synthesized for 5 channels.  There are simply fewer compromises.  The result is that in 1080p on an 11.5 foot screen, this is as good as I've seen, period.  A movie about talking cars sounds dopey.  You may fear schmaltzy sentiment.  Expect to have exactly the opposite reaction.  Get it and get it now! Tim Naff

review/text: I did not see Cars in the theaters,but this is another great hit from Pixar.  It teaches a good lesson about appreciation and pay attention to the things  that really matters in life. Laughs are great but lessons are better,I was looking to laugh my tail off but instead it was heart felt with a lot of love. That's what makes Pixar Unique. It's a must have especially for the all kids and adults as well.

review/summary: Pixar's Latest Crowd Pleaser
review/text: The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  "Cars" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this "vehicle," I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see "Cars."  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.  Much like "A Bug's Life" and "The Incredibles," "Cars" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.  Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the "Blue Collar" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.  While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.  The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, "The Incredibles."  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.  Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.  Pixar was perfect in capturing the thrill of a race, with great angles on all the racing action.

review/summary: Cars
review/text: Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is a rookie in a NASCAR type race called the Piston Cup.  When the season ends with him in a tie with his two major rivals, Chick Hicks (Keaton) and The King (Petty), he must head to California for a tie-breaker race.  Along the way, he ends up stranded in Radiator Springs, arrested for traffic violations.  Doc Hudson (Newman), the town judge, sentences him to repair the road before he can leave.  Initially, he just wants to get done and get out, but soon he finds himself making friends with the locals, including Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally (Hunt).  Soon, this cocky race car who had no real friends finds he may not want to leave so fast after all.  When I first saw the trailer for "Cars", I was worried.  It did not look good, and I thought Pixar had its first flop on its hands.  Bumping the release date back six months did not ease my worry.  That being said, "Cars" is an excellent movie.  Pixar, I am sorry that I ever doubted you.  The voices are perfect, especially Wilson, Newman, and Larry the Cable Guy.  The film looks great, with bright colors kids will love.  The story is nice, and like many Pixar movies, focuses on friendship.  The only drawback I can find is that it runs a little long.  Still, it is worth seeing by kids of all ages.

review/summary: Pixar is still doing the best!
review/text: This movie will definetely make you smile!  It's an interesting idea too.  Think about it, some people do treat thier cars like humans!  Even better than other people OR themselves.  It is hard to believe but I've seen them!  I know there are people out there who name their cars.  Admit it!  Anyway, this is a great story for the kid's to learn about winning and losing in life.  But sitting there for two hours might pose a challenge for little Timmy.  "Mommy, mommy, mommy, I need to go to the bathroom."  There was also a moment that reminded me of Toy Story 2, that could've beem cut.  The scene when Lightning Mcqueen is being told how prosperous Radiator Springs was and how the interstate distracted the other cars away from it was kind of typical.  Remeber it was the scene with a Randy Newman written song?  Does it sound like Cowgirl Jessie's story about how Emily (I think that's the girl's name...) forgot about her and left her in a charity box.  It seemed the same.  Well, that's how I felt.  That would've cut about ten minutes.  Other then that, the movie was hillarious, creative, and most importantly, like all Pixar films, it appealed to the young and old.  Good job Pixar!  Keep up the great work!

review/summary: CARS Races Towards Classic Status
review/text: Great movie as expected from Pixar/Disney. To this reviewer, however, the plot of CARS is lifted, and closely resembles the 1991 Michael J. Fox movie, DOC HOLLYWOOD. With that aside, the animation/CGI is breathtaking and the characters are spot-on excellent. Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing. The film may be a little long, and some of the humor may not hold the attention of younger children, but it is excellent for the adults and young adults. Pixar has added to their  list, a film destined to be a classic.

review/summary: Pixar Does It Again
review/text: I was fourtante enough to see an advance screening of this movie and got a gift after so thank you Disney. Now when I heard that a movie about CARS was being made I wondered how can you make a movie out of that? Well, based on Pixar's history, I knew that it would be entertaining and I was right.    The movie is a fun and enjoyable film. The CGI is very well done considering that it's hard to design Cars as they have no personality or anything like that. The voices are well cast especially Paul Newman who, in real life, is really a race car driver. Typecasting? Perhaps but he's perfect for his role as a "washed up" race car. Of course you also have Pixar stable John Ratzenberger as a truck. Used to be John Goodman. Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious as a redneck rusted tow truck. Owen Wilson as the main character of Lightning McQueen. An egotistical selfish person but lovable nontheless.    The moral of the story is basically: Winning isn't everything. There are more important things then winning. And I belive, this being a family film, brings this message across throughout the movie. It's a movie that has heart, laughter, charm,and personality. With CARS I can truly say that we have the first hit of the summer. Not only that, Pixar has another hit. Congratulations.    Stay through the end credits for a surprise.

review/text: After all the hype I expected Cars to be a great movie.  I guess they had a good marketing plan!  The graphics were great, but the story was not.  Several things weren't good for my 3-year-old either, but I guess that's what I have come to expect form G movies anymore.  The H-word is used several times and other "adult" innuendos that I think are totally unnecessary.  If I have to be entertained for the hour and a half long movie to go see it with my child I don't think my motive is right.  Let's make children's movies for the children, and when we need entertainment we can watch our own movies!

review/summary: Pixar Meets NASCAR in "Cars"
review/text: We end up owning the Pixar films on DVD, but still have seen every one in the theatre, and "Cars" was no exception.  My lack of interest in NASCAR didn't help my enjoyment, but the animation effects were amazing and eventually they got around to telling a story about life in the both the fast and slow lanes. Comparison to other Pixar films ("Finding Nemo", "The Incredibles" and the Toy Story films in particular), left "Cars" lacking something, storywise, in my view.

review/summary: Animation looks great in HD
review/text: As always, Animation looks great in HD and Cars is no exception. When I was able to get the movie to work, the picture and sound were incredible. This is a good disc to keep around in order to show off your system.  The reason I have it four stars:  I have the Samsung BD-P1200 and it took 5 tries before I was able to get the disc to load. Like Pirates, Fantastic Four and a few other discs, the java menus really overload the stand alone players. I made sure the disc was clean and after the 5th time of opening the tray and re-inserting the movie the player recognized the disc.  I'm of the opinion they should lay off the java menus and just stick to the basic menus for these movies.  -update-  I have purchased the Panasonic DMP-BD30K and it handles this title just fine. From my experience, it appears that some standalones just don't handle the java menus too well.

review/summary: Grandson wouldn't sit through it
review/text: I found the lack of people in this movie made it kind of silly. Who built the buildings, the racetrack, and the cars themselves? I thought it would have been a little bit more watchable if the cars had humans to deal and relate with. The cars could have spoke to one another on the sly so to speak.  I know this movie was for kids, but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of thought that went into the making of it. I was truly bored along with my grandson trying to watch it.

review/summary: My son would have loved this...
review/text: ...That is, my son would have loved this when he was a kid.  And let's face it, this film seems mostly made with little boys in mind - bright, shiny cars and trucks racing along like so many HotWheels.  The visuals were stunning, the humorous caricatures very droll and amusing.  The story is basically a hot-shot Nascar-like celebrity learning about life and humility in a small town, presumably in the California outback.  However - and this is a personal "however" - I must be too old for envisioning a world where the dominant (indeed, only) lifeform is the car.  Ford Prefect made that same mistake in "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".  In Disney's 1952 original car film, "Susi the Little Coupe" (who looked as if she would have fit into this movie just fine) there were humans around in background roles, and I think a human audience would have been less unsettling than an audience full of cars.  But maybe I am just being picky.

review/summary: Dang.  Makes The Wild and Over the Hedge look like
review/text: well, ARG!  Kids movies.  I mean, Cars actually seemed like a full blown movie, while the aforementioned movies were held together by a paper thin plot.  Over the Hedge was a good 4 star movie, while The Wild was more like 3 star, but I'm getting off track.  Cars is the newest Pixar movie, and the only animated movies I'll be willing to see in theater is a Pixar, Aardman, OR Shrek movie.  I didn't see Cars in theatres because I heard it wasn't as good as the other Pixar movies and not as funny.  MAN I h*te critics sometimes.  This is a very good movie and should win Best Animated movie for the Oscars.  IT was better than A Bug's Life and as good as Monsters Inc.  While I think Finding Nemo and The Incredibles were better this is definately a great movie.  The movie is all about appreciating the little things in life and slowing down.  Its not really funny, its more like a heartfelt, old fashioned movie.  The direction is great, Voice work is great, and to all those people who say it was too long I say, "You have ADD, get some Meds."

review/summary: Life Is A Highway
review/text: First of all, this is a Pixar film. What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere? Anyway, get this film for yourself and take the time to enjoy a little side trip down Route 66.

review/text: =+= Opening Statements =+=  In June 2006, Pixar came out with this film that seemed to be made by the racing gods from heaven. Never had I been excited for a pixar movie in my whole life. Directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranfit, staring Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and many many more. Plus I got a kick out of all the celebraty voices featureing Jay Leno, Richard Petty, Darrel Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt Jr, Michael Schumacher, and Mario Andretti. Thank You for reading my opening shpeal and now...I will continue.  =+= Plot =+=  The story is about a fast talkin' racecar named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). He is living life on the fast lane, he's very popular, and he is about to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup. But, due to a three-way tie in the standings, there has to be a three-man race for the Piston Cup. On the way to the track, McQueen ends out fallign out of his trailer and left for himself on the highway. He somehow finds himself helping re-build a road he destroyed in the little town of Radiator springs. There he meets up with many new friends, like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt). McQueen soon learns to take it easy, and slow it down some in this little town. The plot is very well done, and the story of how Radiator Springs came off the map was very well made.  Plot Score: 5-5  =+= Casting =+=  The casting in this film was perfect. Owen Wilson leading it off with many different talents behind him, such as the legendary Paul Newman, and the very funny John Ratzenberger. Plus with all of the gguest stars, this shaped up to be perfect acting.  Casting score: 5-5  =+= Music =+=  The soundtrack in this movie was excellent. Featureing the song "Route 66" by Chuck Berry and John Mayor. Also "Real Gone" by Sheryl Crow. And my personal favorite "Life is a Highway" by Rascal Flatts. And many many more. Excelent movie soundtrack and in a way, pretty humours for the Cow Tipping part.  Music: 5-5  =+= Final Thoughts =+=  This has to be the best movie that pixar has ever came up with. The humor in this was way up there, and mix that in with great music, and a great cast and crew and what do you have? *Cars* thats what you have. Plus you have an absoulute funny afterward thing with some pixar films CARS style. This movie is perfect for the whole family, and also for all NASCAR fans, you will LOVE this one.  Final Score: 5-5  BTW: Just Thinkin is me...I needed a new account.

review/summary: Pixar. Teaching Good Values.
review/text: Pixar and Disney are a wonderful team. After huge successes like "Toy Story" "A Bug's Life" "Toy Story 2" "Monster's Inc." and "Finding Nemo," they come out with another Box Office winner in "Cars." But compared to their previous releases, I rank this latest offering last. It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings. A reminder to all of us that, winning is not nearly as important, as how we treat others in the process of achieving our goals. Something every child in the audience needs to hear, and possibly every adult even more so.

review/summary: Not bad, but...
review/text: I'm as big a Pixar fan as they come. I grew up with Toy Story, and they really hit their stride with flicks like Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Cars, though? Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.  I freely admit that this is just a personal thing, but I found no part of this movie particularly funny, interesting, or entertaining. I really like the concept and the kind of humor that could get out of it, but as far a i could see, their was no reason that the characters were cars. No attempt at any sort of car-related humor was attempted as far as I could see, and I think it was more of an excuse for Pixar to not have to animate people, because their people always look a little... well... scary.  All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring. the action was standard, the characters weren't really all that interesting (certainly not as interesting or complex as Finding Nemo's cast was) and I ultimately found myself checking my watch while watching it; never a good sign. The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie. The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater. I just wanted to punch him, he was so annoying.  If you like this film, power to you. If you haven't seen this movie, trust me; go watch Finding Nemo again, or go see The Incredibles, that's an okay one too. Just don't waste your time; Cars isn't worth it.

review/summary: Not the best of the Pixar bunch
review/text: Of all the movies Pixar has made this one left me the least amused once I left the theatre.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is cute (but not really funny).  The soundtrack is great for the movie but it's pretty cliche.  The soundtrack in particular does not hold a candle to the ones Randy Newman made for the Toy Story movies.  "Life is a Highway" rocks out and starts the movie with a serious bang, but my 6 year old thought it was too loud.  A lot of little kids were holding their ears at the start of the movie.  The plot is entertaining but it doesn't really function on that "next level" that many of the Pixar movies do.  And it is impossible not to remember "Doc Hollywood" with Michael J. Fox and think Fox would not have been better than Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen.  I guess I think Monsters, Inc. and the Toy Story movies were much better than this one because they created characters that expanded out of the worlds of children.  Also, Monster, Inc. and Finding Nemo both talk to the adults in the audience about parenting while entertaining the kids you went with to the movie.  It's just genius that they can pull that off.  I don't see Cars trying to pull off anything so admirable, heck, it doesn't even function on a level other than the one the kids are watching, too.  I admit there is a nostalgia thing going that kids might not quite understand but it is an upfront part of the movie plot.  The nostalgia gets a little drippy too and probably takes aim at grandparents more than 35-year-old parents because it is all about "life before the interstate" which was created in the late 50's early 60's...

review/summary: so far, so good...
review/text: Disney movies really aren't my thing.  For example, I recently bought a few movies from WalMart: Serenity, Slither, and Final Destination II... none of which are Disney movies.  I used to think that Disney movies were mainly for kids. Granted, I do have the entire Lilo and Stitch series, but beyond that, my late Disney experiences have been from watching old WD movies like Beauty and the Beast and Finding Nemo with my 5-year old cousin (and don't take that as a rip on Finding Nemo; I actually really liked that movie).  What really attracted me to Cars in the first place, however, was the fact that it had Larry the Cable Guy in it, as the lovable but somewhat dimwitted Tow Mater (known throughout the film simply as Mater), seeing as I am a HUGE fan of Larry's material.  I finally got to see the movie as a result of a bootleg copy I got from a friend.  I must say, it is one of THE best Disney movies I have ever seen.  It was very family-friendly and overall quite hilarious.  *Warning- Spoilers Ahead... Proceed With Caution*  The premise is quite simple: a NASCAR-like superstar named Lightning McQueen is one of three cars that tied for entrance into the Piston Cup, one of the most premier races in the nation.  While on his way to the race, however, his transport truck Mac falls asleep, allowing Lightning to roll out the back of Mac's tailflap; when Lightning awakens, he chases down what he thinks is Mac, but isn't.  He finally stops in the quiet little town of Radiator Springs... but not before ripping a statue of an engine out of its base and completely tearing up the main road through the city.  The judge and town lawyer (who happens to be a very attractive female car [I feel really weird saying that]) sentence him to repave the road before he can leave for the race.  He ends up having to repave the road twice, cause the first time he didn't do it right and the road was all bumpy.  Throughout the film, Lightning's pride almost stops him from being able to make the friendships he does while in Radiator Springs; guys like Mater (played/voiced superbly by Blue Collar Comedy Tour regular Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty old pickup truck who runs a towing company (Tow Mater... get it?  hahaha... ok.  I'll stop.) and Doc Hudson, a old (1951, I believe) Hudson Hornet who was the winner of 3 Piston Cups during his own racing days.  He eventually becomes Mater's "new best friend" and goes out on a tractor-tipping expedition with him... which, btw, is one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.  The movie ends like you wouldn't expect it to (hint: Lightning doesn't win the Piston Cup), but Lightning ends up making a decision that leaves everyone watching with a nice, warm, happy feeling inside.  ^_^  One of the nice things about Cars is that, like Finding Nemo, it is quite the unconventional movie.  The title suggests that the movie will have something to do with racing and/or cars, but the real delight is in that the main characters are the cars, not the racecar drivers; in fact, there are no drivers.  The cars in Cars are completely autonomous (they move on their own) but can talk, drive, and overall act like regular humans... remind you of the fish in Finding Nemo (which reminds me... I haven't reviewed F.N. yet... watch for my review a bit later).  It's also, as I said, very funny, yet completely "safe for the whole family", to borrow the slogan of a local Christian radio station.  I personally loved the movie and would highly and enthusiastically recommend this for anyone who loves movies about cars... or for that matter movies in general.  Rated: G  Andy ~O~

review/summary: Cars is excellent choice!
review/text: After receiving this movie, I decided to go through the reviews, and was totally disgusted at many of the 1-star reviews. Those people totally downgrade every movie and make this movie to be all horrible when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about. I was appalled at that one moron who whined about how this isn't a good "Christian" movie because there's some name-calling in this movie by some of the cars in the script. Get a life, you schmuck. This isn't some Bible movie you bought, so get over it. This movie was excellent! I can watch it a thousand times and never get tired of it. I'm also looking into buying the sequel too. And considering that over 800 people made reviews of this movie and how barely a handful of them are one-star reviews, the others clearly know what they're saying when they claim this movie rocks the house. I'd give it a lot more than five stars, but that's clearly the highest you can go. What a shame!

I've owned a Blu-ray player (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J4VQ">PlayStation 3 120 GB</a>) and and HDTV (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U3Y8QI">Samsung LN46B630 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color</a>) for several years now and I have dozens of Blu-ray movies.  Cars is simply stunning in Blu-ray, hands down it is one of the best movies to watch on Blu-ray.  The picture quality is seriously jaw dropping.

review/summary: Charming.  Heartwarming.  Innocent.
review/text: Pixar is really at the top of their game.  Cars is a unique animated film that highlights how the negative emotions such as greed and lust will ultimately lead to displeasure and misery in life.  It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.  The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.  It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.

review/summary: Too many storylines gives a slow and overlong middle of the film; otherwise it's great!
review/text: Cars suffers from that common fatal error of many films - the editor didn't (or wasn't allowed to) do his/her job.  Cars, which skirts dangerously close to the 2-hour mark, is simply too long for a kids movie.  Yes, I know the Roger Ebert maxim, "No good film is too long, no bad film is too short", but my young son gets bored at the 80 minute mark, especially since the hero has been stuck in first gear for the last 60 minutes.  The story: hotshot Rookie Owen Wilson ... er, Lightning McQueen finishes his first season in the Piston Cup circuit in a 3-way points tie with veterens The King and Chick Hicks.  It is decided to have a race-off between the three cars to determine who should win the prestigious Cup.  Off the three cars head to Los Angeles, but Lightning manages to get lost and arrested in Radiator Springs - a one-stoplight town on Route 66, bypassed by the Interstate system and forgotten.  The town's grizzled doctor and circuit judge makes Lightning repair the road he tore up.  As he works in the town, Lightning learns a little about humility, a little about love, and a lot about life.  The opening NASCAR-esque race sequence is by far the highlight of the film for me (and for my son).  The power, the speed, and the sounds of a day at the race track are lovingly reproduced, and even a non-racing fan like myself finds the sequence amazing.  Unfortunately, the middle slows down to a crawl and lasts about 30 minutes too long.  I think the problem is that the creators gave equal time to Lightning's three new relationships in the town - with Mater, the wise-cracking tow truck; with Sally, the big-city Porsche who wanted a slower life; and with Doc (voiced by the late great Paul Newman), the old-timer with a secret.  The film should have been a double-redemption story: Lightning learning what life's all about, while in parallel Doc faces his past and overcomes his bitterness.  If the filmakers had more clearly focussed on this story, and allowed the other two plotlines to recede to subplots, the film would have been focussed and more enjoyable (not to mention cheaper to make!).  So the film only rates a 3/4 for me.  The other star is lost because this DVD edition is not up to the standards of other Pixar and John Lassiter offerings.  While there are some nifty little vignettes on Route 66, NASCAR racing, etc., they are just that: little.  There is no director's commentary either.  Don't get me wrong - there is a LOT to like about this film.  The voices are supurb, as usual.  The races are exciting, the sound is crisp and immersive, and the video is sharp.  The characters are fun and are worthy of inclusion in the Disney pantheon.  But small children will lose interest because the filmakers allowed themselves to meander in the middle 1/2 of the film.

review/text: An arrogant young race car (Owen Wilson) has his eyes opened to what really matters in life when he finds himself stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten little town on Route 66 where folks still care about each other.  There is a lot to enjoy in this movie.  The animation is spectacular, the voice talent is top-notch, and it presents good lessons about respect for the simple, enduring pleasures of life and the false allure of fame.  Despite these strengths and some good laughs, I didn't connect with this film on an emotional level.  I think I just wasn't captivated by the concept of characters developed from cars, but my two-year-old son certainly was, and his opinion probably counts more than mine.

review/summary: great kids movie with very little violence and NO death - wow!
review/text: Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many "kids" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  "Finding Nemo" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out "A Bug's Life."  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.  I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of "life and death" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is "the bad guy" and "a meanie," he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their "enemies."  In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend.

review/text: As is usual with a Pixar film, Cars has excellent visuals, and they really shine in the Blu-Ray version of the film.  The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.  If you're looking to build a complete collection of Pixar on Blu-Ray, it's worth the money.

The digital transfer is top-notch, the picture is crystal clear and the sound is great (too bad I don't own a FullHD set nor a sound system that supports uncompressed sound signals).I must add that unlike 'Ratatouille' the movie plays just fine in an European Blu-ray disc player (I'm from Europe). The bad? The product info is wrong, this edition doesn't feature French nor Spanish subtitles, so Amazon should update the product specs. It must've been a last minute decision as the distributor had to include an additional cardboard insert (over the original cover) with updated technical info that does reflect the lack of these features. Must buy!

review/summary: It just misses... (That's an auto joke. Get it? Tom and Ray would...)
review/text: There aren't any new plots, and most stories have predictable endings. Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).  "Cars" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of "Spirited Away", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.  "Cars" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch "Cars" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the "Toy Story"s, "A Bug's Life", or "The Incredibles", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)  The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The "making of" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. "Mater and the Ghostlight" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while "One-Man Band" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)  I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon "Susie, the Little Blue Coupe", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.  PS: Disney HD showed "Cars" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing. My feelings haven't changed. "Cars" lacks the surprises and twists of most other Pixar films, chugging its way to a predetermined finish. It just isn't much fun.

review/summary: Pixar's Best Film to Date...
review/text: With thew somewhat dissapointing "Rattatouille", you may find yourself wondering "Does Pixar still have magic?  Or are they being eaten by the Disney Moster?"  It is a legitimate question, and one that I will answer with one word: CARS.    You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date, which would mean it is better than the "Toy Story" films and "Finding Nemo".  The reason this claim has been made is because although "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" were amazing, "Cars" succeeds on a few ways that those movies do not.    Let us start with a synopsis.  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name "Lightning McQueen" (voiced by Owen Wilson" is living life in the "fast lane".  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called "Radiatory Springs".  It seems to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the point lessons he has failed to learn up to that point.    The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the characters that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated characters for children like "Tow Mater" (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), more serious characters like "Doc" that is embittered, and sober-minded.    While most these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they here.  Even if we cannot agree with me on this, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will forget you are watching a "cartoon".  This is one animated movie that will stand the test of time fifty years down the road and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.    I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!    God Bless ~Amy

review/summary: This is the best toy-oriented movie since Toy Story!
review/text: The movie is great. Some things could be improved like why McQueen has its original colors in the final race instead of having the new "Radiator Springs" colors (as it appeared at the end). My son loves it and he didn't stop seeing this movie at home since the release of the DVD.  Only this movie and Toy Story have the revolutionary idea of thinking about the movie AND the toys. The others only have the typical "not-so-look-alike" figures or not-so-funny-to-play-with toys.  This movie brought us the great idea of mixing the Matchbox/HotWheels collection with the movie characters. My son loves any type of toy cars like most of the boys (and many men) but he loves die-cast cars by far.  There isn't any movie that used this option (die-cast cars) for its characters and the idea of a growing collection set. That's why I think there is innovation in this movie.  I hope they give us a second movie (and more die-cast cars).

So grab some popcorn, pile up with your family & enjoy this one!

review/summary: A Disney/Pixar Triumph!!!
review/text: With a genius that only a Disney/Pixar partnership can create, Cars comes off as one of the most entertaining movies of the last several years. With characters like Lightning McQueen, Tow Mater, Doc Hudson and the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Larry The Cable Guy and Paul Newman just to name a few, this movie delivers time and again! There are lessons/morals that can teach kids about priorities and what not, but there are enough laughs for both little kids and big kids alike!  Radiator Springs is brilliantly-colored and the inhabitants come to life in this cinematic event. I loved it!

review/summary: Fun movie, love story and moral lesson
review/text: Though we knew we'd like the animation we were a little skeptical about a movie with a NASCAR-theme because we are not particularly fans of it. But we were pleasantly surprised to find a nice love story and moral lesson woven into it. We ended up seeing it twice in the theaters and just had to buy it.

review/text: What can I say? When I saw previews I thought they would not pull this one off! Was I wrong. My kids love it. Clever characters, great voice talent. The animation is a step up, look at the relections and shadows-very realistic! Just a great all round film to put on the shelf with Toy Story, Bugs Life, etc..

review/summary: Stop and Smell the Pavement
review/text: Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.  On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.  Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.  But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?  This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.  All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.  And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.  Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the "One Man Band" short that showed in theaters before this movie.  While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar.

review/summary: Cars
review/text: Lightning McQueen is a cocky, self-centered racecar (voiced by Owen Wilson) who thinks winning is everything.  One day while going to California, McQueen gets left in the middle of the street (accidentally of course).  He goes to Radiator Springs where he accidentally tears up the road.  McQueen is sentenced to fix the road.  While at Radiator Springs, McQueen has a change of heart; he finds out the true meaning of winning is not actually getting the most trophies, it's being a good sport and believing in yourself.  ..also starring the voice talents of Bonnie Hunt as Sally, and Paul Newman as Doc, cars in Radiator Springs.  This is a really good movie!  It has its funny moments.  The cars Guido and Luigi had my dad and I laughing hysterically!!  I don't know about my dad, but this film gave me a warm feeling inside once I left the theatre.

review/summary: Doc Hollywood Rehashed
review/text: I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically "Sullivan Travels" or more exactly "Doc Hollywood." There is a little "An officer and a Gentlemen" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the "Car" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch "Doc Hollywood" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck.

review/text: This movie followed the Disney formula to a "t"---a little non sexual romance, in jokes for the parents and older children, simple story line with clear good guys and bad guys spelled out---except this time, it was directed more for the little "princes" than the "princesses".  Not that both won't enjoy it. Like Finding Nemo, it was a completely enjoyable little film to entertain your children.  However, unlike Finding Nemo, there was no real depth to the film.  Take it for what it is and you'll like it very much.  It's VERY good but not a future classic.

review/summary: Gentlemen: Start Your Engines
review/text: The premise for this tale is not dissimilar from other Pixar/Disney pictures.  The plot begins with at the Final race that will determine who is the best of three cars and the winner of the much touted Piston Cup: 1.  The current champion in his last race; 2. The one who has always been a step behind; and 3. the young rookie in his very first season.  The race unconvincingly ends in a 3-way-tie partly caused by the rookie's (Lightning McQueen) cockiness.  The result is another race in California, winner take all.  The story finally gets moving when Lightning gets separated from his trailer (MACK), and sentenced to repairing the road in a sleepy town off old Route 66.  This moving is a far cry from Finding Nemo and The Incredibles that involved parent/child relationships, but it holds its own.  Lightning must learn that his cocky attitude and always wanting to work alone has left him searching for "an empty cup".  There are also some great characters to meet along the way.  Tow Mater is a dim-witted tow truck that likes to go "Tractor-Tipping".  Sally, a sleek and sexy Porsche Carrera, owns the local motel.  Doc Hudson the local town judge has some secrets of his own. A hippie VW van and an old WWII era Army jeep add a running joke.  Unfortunately, we never quite feel that Lightning has learned his lesson until the end.  Most of the characters don't ever truly worm their way into your heart.  Visually, this movie is breathtaking. During some scenes it is nearly impossible to tell that you're watching an animated film.  The race sequences are heart stopping.  And one event as a forgotten town lights up in the glorious neon glow of 40 years ago will leave many parents smiling.  Also, everything in this movie is related to cars:  there are flying VW bugs instead of flies; the cars do the "wave" by revving up and flashing their headlights; characters go "tractor-tipping" instead of cow tipping, and drink oil at the local drive-in diner.  Parents should know that some of the scenes are intense and several of the Chrome and Fiberglass extras are violently taken out of the scene and crunched, though none seem to be seriously injured.  Talk to children about why Doc Hudson believes that Lightning is after an empty cup, and ask what the difference is between the ways "yeah, okay" is said and what they mean.  What did Lightning really learn from all this?  Parents may also want to talk to their children about Historic Route 66 and its impact on the Country.  If you're looking for a good film, with flashy effects and a catchy sound track then this is it.  If, like me, you love all things Disney, then see this as an appetizer for Pirates.  And make sure you stay through the end of the credits.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: I have enjoyed many G rated "kiddie" movies over the years, but this is not one that I would ever watch again.  The movie starts off somewhat exciting, but as soon as you start to get into the action, it becomes boring and uneventful.  I felt like the majority of the movie was like a long, slow story about how the main character learns humility.  Okay, maybe this would have been okay, but not for most of the movie.  Somewhere along the lines there has to be more action and humor.  The funny moments are few and far between.  Most of the humor relies on jokes about how the other characters are presented.  How this is supposed to be funny for a over an hour is beyond me.  You giggle about how the characters talk for a few minutes and then you look for more, but you don't get it.  After all of this, the movie has a rather boring ending that almost makes you feel let down after you have waited for so long for more action.  In the end I would have to say that this one is a rental only.  I would never watch it again and the kids that I know were all unimpressed.  Nobody asked Santa for this one.

review/summary: A Parent's Review: Not as Much Fun for Me
review/text: I have to admit.  I was really looking forward to this movie.  I mean really.  The teaser that had been playing for almost two years during previous visits to the theater with my 3 kids left me giddy with excitement.  Okay, yes, I acknowledge that I am strange, yet I am not alone, I assure you of that.  Like millions of others, I have come to expect from Pixar Films intelligent, witty, and charming productions that serve up as many laughs (if not more) for adults as for their diminutive counterparts.  I mean, it's to the point where I am more excited to go to the films my eleven-year-old is now beginning to outgrow.  So, I was looking forward to "Cars" and perhaps my expectations were too high.  While it was charming and sweet in a safe sort of way, the film just lacks the spunk and general pizzazz that we have come to expect from the people who brought us "Toy Story", "A Bug's Life", "Finding Nemo", and "The Incredibles".  Lacking in cultural allusions, innuendo, and similar word play, the film is just okay.  Perhaps the fact that the main writing of the screenplay is credited to three writers with virtually nothing under their belts is an indication of why this venture lacks the expected luster of a Pixar movie.  And yet...some questions I need to ask myself...  Is it fun and appropriate for its target audience?  Yes.  Does it have a nicely wrapped-up moral that is delivered well, but not too heavily?  Sure.  Are the visuals bright and fun to look at for about an hour and a half?  Absolutely.  So, was it torture to sit and watch it with my kids?  No.  Most importantly, my kids liked it and it still beats "Baby Geniuses" by a long shot. And yet, it is with more reservation that I will walk into a Pixar film in the future...although I will admit that the teaser for "Ratatouille" looks great!

review/summary: How many laps was that?!
review/text: In the end, after a long race and countless detours, Cars comes swinging around the final turn with a pretty nice message about life. About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. "It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game," etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?  But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.  The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like "cookie cutter" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.  Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.  Nah. It'll never happen.

review/summary: Contests are fun, but they are not Life
review/text: "Cars" is the first Pixar movie I did not buy immediately. But finally I got tired of waiting for the rental copy, and I bought it.  The delay was due to the trailer not really doing much for me. Also, I felt that cars is a dubious choice for animated characters. Unlike bugs or toys, they don't have arms or faces, so it's a little forced, methinks.  That said, I'd have to say they pulled it off. Actually, looking at real cars after having seen this movie, I half expect them to move and open their eyes.  "Cars" is not the best or funniest Pixar movie. My faves are Monsters Inc, Toy Story 2, and The Incredibles. But "Cars" was still very worthwhile, I enjoyed it. And it is visually gorgeous. The scenery especially is amazing.  If you get the DVD, be sure not to miss the extras. The two shorts included, for one thing, are falling-over funny.  I also appreciate the basic message of the movie: winning is not everything. The western world is still a bit fixated on Being Number One. And contests can be fun and they can be inspiring, but ultimately they are just games, they are not life.

review/summary: Kids love it
review/text: We bought this for our 2 kids for Christmas, having already seen it in the theaters last summer.  Even though they are 4 years apart in age (5 year old boy, 9 year old girl), they both enjoy watching it and have seen it several more times since the holidays.  One of the reasons I like it is that there is no "bad guy" as you often find in other Disney/kids movies.  And for adults (who often have to sit there and watch the movie as well!), there are a lot of "cameo" appearances, via voice, of famous NASCAR-related characters which keep it interesting.  Overall, a good family movie.

review/summary: Great Movie with little DVD extras
review/text: Cars is a great movie, and my son (and my whole family) continue to love the story and characters. Anyone who has not seen the movie yet, should go buy this great movie with a great story.  Unfortunately, there is little on the DVD but the movie itself. This is uncommon, and leaves me feeling that there will be another release with director commentary or some other extra. I somehow feel cheated these days when I get a DVD without a director's commentary.

review/text: This will be short and sweet. Animation of yesteryears compared to the today animation have made tremendous strides. I felt with "Cars" I was actually watching a real life movie. You can totally relate with whats going on! My husband and I are grandparents to a 2.5 year old and when he comes over the first thing he wants to do is watch "Cars". This movie is great for all ages and I highly recommend it. It deserves a oscar for best animation, music, so on. Congrats to Disney (Pixar) again! Being a Child of the 50's I grew up with Disney and their stories have brought so much joy to Our lives.

review/summary: Movie of the Year to me an old guy. Great for kids, too
review/text: My wife and I watched the DVD three weeks ago at home and immediately regarded it as "Movie of the Year". The CG is stunning as expected, but it's success is primarily attributed to the great story/script and the outstanding details which captivate its audience all the way. I had the impulse to write a review immediately then but had been stopped by the many negative reviews that complained it's too targeted at adults and not so good for kids as other Pixar movies. I thought, "May be I am really too old (40) and so I have rated too high an animaion that tributed to the aged or the veterans." However, last night, when we were in a mall watching an AV shop showing it in a 42" 1080P True HD Sony LCDTV, together with many little kids and their parents, we were attracted not only by the fantastic video effect (We only have a 29" CRT at home and were astonished by how much visual details we missed), but how parents got to drag/pull/tow their kids away. In one case, a father simply put his 3-4 yr old son on his shoulder like a bag of flour and walked away. The cute beautiful angel, with his smiling face, waived "Bye! Bye! Car, Car."

review/summary: Another Animation Success
review/text: Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.  But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.  The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win "The Piston Cup." But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on "the highway." Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.  Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.  That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout.

review/summary: Toys, fish, cars...what's next?
review/text: If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.  When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.  Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.  Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.  When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.  Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.  Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.

review/text: Let me echo what others have said: this is the best blu-ray I've seen yet.  The picture is brilliant of course, but the PCM sound at 24 bits will also rock your speakers.  The special in-movie features are the best implementation so far of what blu-ray can offer us.  You can feel the dedication and love when watching them - so removed from some of the tacked on 10 'making of' bits we get even on most blu-ray today. This disk should be held as a standard to other studios when they whine about people not buying enough blu ray.  If every disk were like this I'd be broke buying them.

review/summary: Ka Chow!  Cars is a Hit!
review/text: Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic.  Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey.  Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66.  Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through.  Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, so he tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before.  Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him.  As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life.  This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!

review/summary: Sentimental Highway
review/text: Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the "simpler" days of bygone years.  "Cars" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar "Lightning McQueen," only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But "Cars" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.  "Cars" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But "Cars" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.  Animated or not, "Cars" is a crashing bore for the little kids. The soundtrack veers too much toward mawkishness, and the languid vistas conjured up by the filmmakers are too glorious for small minds. There's too much story, too much unfathomable nostalgia and not enough racing. The kids in the theater where I saw the film were losing their minds.  But for those of us with a bit of wear on our tires, "Cars" gets us where we want to go - a few minutes rest from the hustle-bustle of the Highway We Call Life.

review/summary: Doesn't have broad appeal. Predictable and Un-charming.
review/text: Cars was the first Pixar production to disappoint me. For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.  The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?  The plot was a transparent recycling of "Doc Hollywood", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.  Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.  I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars.

review/summary: Just for Kids. If They Can Stay Awake.
review/text: "Cars" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of "Cars" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.  "Cars" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. "Cars" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy "Cars", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since "Finding Nemo", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.  The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. "Mater and the Ghostlight" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. "One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to "'Cars", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. "Epilogue" (4 min) is the last part of "Cars" that played over the credits. In "Inspiration for Cars" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with "Route 66: The Mother Road" author Michael Wallis. Subtitles for the film are available in English only.

review/summary: Another Winner For Disney/Pixar. First Place Again.
review/text: Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.  Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.  Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death. The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition. Good way for a terrific actor to make his final bow.  Rated G.

review/summary: One of the best movies in a while!
review/text: My son has yet to sit through an entire movie at the theaters so I just waited until the DVD came out.  I did get him the Leapster Cars game so he already had an interest before he got the DVD.  I rented it first and kept it for a week (gotta love blockbuster's new policy).  He LOVED the movie and like kid's everywhere watched it over and over and over. There was disappointment when the DVD was returned but 2days later, TADA!!  Daddy comes home with an Amazon.com box with goodies for all.  The movie itself was amazing.  I love the age-old technique of putting thinly veiled adult themes that aren't offensive to kids (they just think it's funny) but appeal to adults.  Like the Bumper-eze (preparation-h) and the piss in piston cup via Mater.  The Ghost Light was OK but thankfully someone put some effort and gives some value to a DVD release!  DTS would have been nice but I've almost forgotten what that better than 5.1 encoding does to my 500W sub....  One final bonus (some might beg to differ) is the endless range of toys/clothes/and other themed (even Kleenex!) goodies are out there for holiday shopping for your kids!  I've (ebayed) pj's, slippers, and a 16set of matchbox cars so far.  Plus Amazon sells books by the dozen.  5/5 Stars for me!

review/summary: Takes a while to get out of first gear, then hauls asphalt.
review/text: The first time I tried to watch this movie I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with "Lightning McQueen" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says "I'm a one man show".  Hey, there is no "man" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?  Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.  To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.  I liked "Doc" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.  I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.  So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by "adult" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.  Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?  And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?  The bonus featurs are fun, like the "One Man Band" cartoon and the extra "Cars" cartoon.  The "deleted scenes" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.  Finally, this DVD just seems like "round one".  A year from now there will likely be the "Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again.

The movie is great, but the execution/delivery of the DVD is sub-par at best.

review/summary: "Here in my car, I feel safest of all . . ."---Gary Numan
review/text: CARS is by far the weakest of the collaborations by Disney and Pixar. The animation is certainly up to Pixar's very high standards. Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen. CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles. It is the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), rookie racer nonpareil, who is in a run-off in a three way tie in the Piston Cup. Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.  On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Pulled over, he faces the town judge, "Doc" Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a lifelong racer himself). Doc is about to let Lightning go when the town Attorney Sally Carrera (a Porsche, voiced by Bonnie Hunt), convinces Doc to lock him up for destruction of property. Lightning must do Community Service before he can get on his way.  I found myself strangely troubled by CARS. The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity. There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.  CARS lacks the heart of the TOY STORY films and FINDING NEMO. Quite surprisingly, the characters in CARS aren't very nice to one another, or, for that matter, nice at all. Lightning is cocky, and riding for a fall. That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling. The morality of CARS is convoluted and unclear, and certainly much more complicated than it should be for a film supposedly directed at children. Personal vendettas underlie much of the film's momentum.  Lightning is a self-described "one man show" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.  Sally Carerra has Lightning convicted not because of the minor property damage he has caused but because she dislikes the glitz and glam he admires (something she turned her back on when she came to Radiator Springs). She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.  Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public. Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments. Doc wants Lightning to pay the price for his own unhappiness.  The rest of the denizens of the town spend most of their time complaining about how the Interstate has passed them by. Their shops are dusty. There's no business. But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster. Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine). Mater calls Lightning, "my best friend," but Lightning never reciprocates.  Ironically, things don't change in Radiator Springs until Lightning repaves the road. The rest of the town's cars get to work, painting and fixing and replacing the burnt-out neon bulbs on the roadside joints. Radiator Springs spruces up, but it definitively says something that not one of the natives bothered to get off their rusty tailpipes to do anything to fix the town until after they force Lightning to do the dirty work.  Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero. Having learned a lesson about community, Lightning goes on to a surprising finish in the run-off race.  With its ethics badly in need of a tune up, I think it'd be all right for your kids to miss CARS.

review/summary: Really, only Pixar could make NASCAR entertaining.
review/text: Cars (John Lasseter,2006)  The main problem I have with Cars will not be shared by the majority of its viewers, nor even the majority of Americans. It's the naked end result of a love affair with NASCAR, and all NASCAR represents. Still, if anyone can take NASCAR and make it worth watching, it's Pixar. And they do a relatively good job of it, despite the instant-death casting moves of putting Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy (are you getting the "all NASCAR represents" vibe yet?) in two major roles.  Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Wilson), a self-absorbed rookie racer who overcomes overwhelming obstacles to finish in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup, racing's greatest honor. (That he put himself in the position to be burdened with overwhelming obstacles is a minor, but important, point.) The talking heads decree that The three finishers-- McQueen, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton)-- will have a race-off in California in one week. On the way there, thanks to various shenannigans, McQueen finds himself stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, having caused a great deal of damage to the stretch of Route 66 that passes through the town. The town judge, Doc (Paul Newman), sentences McQueen to repave the section of road he destroyed. Which, of course, leads to McQueen getting to know the locals and coming to care about something other than his own existence. Roll credits, another happy ending in the books.  So, yeah, it's predictable. But the predictability doesn't take into account the Pixar magic, which flows as strongly as ever here. And I mean strong-- if it can make me like anything even remotely NASCAR-related (or Larry the Cable Guy related), there's some serious mojo workin' in the Pixar studios.  It's not much of a surprise that Cars works as well as it does; Lasseter was the guy behind both Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life, three of Pixar's strongest offerings. He uses the same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula. After all, it's a formula because it works.  Pixar strikes again. ***

review/text: First off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.  Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..  However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..  This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..  Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft.. That's a huge crime in itself.

Sure, there are some funny lines littered throughout the film, but as far as consistent humor it was sorely lacking.  The story from the beginning didn't really grab me, but with the right touch it could have eventually.  Larry the Cable Guy was by far the best thing to happen to this cartoon, but even he couldn't make me love it.  I will never be caught saying I wasn't impressed by it's beauty, I mean, I may not like the movie but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't impressed in some ways, but I may also never be caught watching this movie again since aside from the animation there was nothing much to hold my attention.

review/summary: Visually Amazing...However
review/text: *Note - As many times, when the film is considered a "kid's" film, I watch my two children's reactions to the film.  10-yrs & 8-yrs...  As I viewed Cars, I was stunned at how beautiful and amazing computer animation has become.  It has evolved from a novelty, to truly a beautiful form of art.  Cars, especially the scenery, was visually amazing...AMAZING!!!  However...  I noticed my children fidgeting throughout the film.  I could tell that they were losing interest rather quickly.  I did not see them laughing out loud with any frequency.  Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in the popcorn, rather than the film.  Afterwards I asked them how they liked the film and they just shrugged their shoulders.  There was never a moment that one could really feel sorry for Lightning McQueen or emphasize with him.  He was arrogant and self-serving as Chick Hicks was, although not as nasty...  Cars failed in one major way that the other Pixar/Disney films succeeded in...Cars failed to have characters that my children (or my wife or I) cared about.  They were funny, but we did not feel emotionally invested in anyone.  Pixar, up until now, always had films that had great stories first and great graphics was a bonus.  This seemed that they put the graphics first and the story second.  One other thing...if you are not a big racing fan, which my wife and two children are not, many of the jokes and cameos will go right over your head...thank goodness for Mater...

review/summary: Cars (Widescreen Edition)
review/text: Cars (Widescreen Edition)~ Owen Wilson is a good animated movie that I feel is a bit too oriented towards the American market. Most people in the rest of the world do not watch Nascar and therefore many of the Nascar references are lost on people that do not watch it. The animation is great, the storyline is well written, the music is really good. The message of the movie is that one needs to take responsibility for ones actions, be tolerant and not be haughty. The story centers around a haughty race car called Lightning McQueen that learns respect, tolerance and the true meaning of family. It started out poorly and just became better and better. But still I give it 4 stars out of 5.

review/text: Cars is a fun filled film that is enjoyable for the whole family. Cars is about a race car, Lightning McQueen, that seeks fame and happiness in in all the wrong places. He thinks true happiness is in fame, fortune, and fine oil. He later realizes that happiness is not found in those things but through friendships and the cars he cares about most. The authors very well got their point across. True happiness is found when you please those around you. This film is full of humor, heartwarming events, and is enjoyable for the whole family.

review/summary: Not very relevant to international viewers.
review/text: Okay, unless you are an ex-pat or just plain American or you closely follow NASCAR racing, you would find this movie very entertaining.  However, I'm none of those. Aren't Disney movies aimed to entertain 90% of the worlds population? Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not an anti-Disney activist but, this movie in my mind definitely did not live up to its media hype.  Saw it at the theatre on the first week it was out with my easily amused significant other... hmm alright, I thought. Maybe I'll grow on me. (by the way, no one in the theatre on the opening week of a movie in the middle of New Zealands largest city at 7pm? Thats saying something)  Second time I saw it, the kids who watched it with me got up and left during the first 10 minutes.. kids who usually pay attention to movies.  Third time I saw it, I thought, whoa. I just don't know whats funny.  At first glance it has the elements of a fantastic family movie.. Owen Wilson, a great story line, awesome animation, catchy soundtrack, little off jokes to entertain the older siblings and parents... awesome!!...but the very exclusive, very American NASCAR jokes went way over my head.  Although, it is not Disney/Pixar's best feature film, I will give it props for creating Luigi. He is very, very cute.

review/text: I'm a language teacher and I have a number of DVDs that I use at school as language tools.  DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English.  Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD.  I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I suppose it's my fault for assuming, but I feel ripped off just the same.

review/summary: lived up to my expectations
review/text: For years I've been trying to explain my "no Disney" stance to people.  Grandparents.  Aunts and Uncles.  My own kids.  People act as though I am out of my mind when I say the movies are too suspenseful for little children, lacking in positive male role models, somewhat vulgar, and hostile to families.  So it's spring break.  We got Cars.  You can be sure a Disney movie will have engaging characters and a snazzy plot.  Cars does have those.  But... Wrapped inside this amazingly beautiful animation are some rotten spots.  Now I'm hoping my kids forget this movie quickly.  Lightning McQueen raced a train because he was in a hurry, and my heart just sank.  What did my kids just see?  How do you undo that?  Language like "moron" and "hillbilly hell" and "holy shoot" -- who wants to hear that coming out of a child?  Because they are *going* to repeat it.  Lightning disparagingly calls Doc "Grandpa" and rejects his advice.  Nice.  I want to watch a movie with characters my kids can emulate.  The outside world will come soon enough.  I don't want this movie to be a formative one for my kids.  And so you say, "Lighten up, it's just a movie."  Well, ok.  But what goes in through their eyes, stays in there.  Otherwise, why would marketing work?  Anyway, once is enough for this family... and I remain a Disney skeptic.  Sad.

Cars was unfortunately not a five star, not even the four star of Bug's Life.  I think Pixar has forgotten what they do.  They created animated film that appeal to the family.  Cars spends too much time on scenery, and it draws out each moment as if it were some drama reflecting the human condition.  It has neither pep or comedy.  What was done well, was not really what the movie should be.  The most memorable moment is a long romantic drive between two talking cars.

review/summary: Great movie but this DVD is a HUGE disappointment for true Pixar fans.
review/text: This movie is great family entertainment.  My kids love it and I really enjoy it.  I think it says a lot about the incredible people at Pixar that THIS is probably their weakest film.  My major disappointment is with the DVD.  Pixar has always had great "Special Edition" DVD releases. With each film they've improved the features. They usually have close to an hour's worth of `behind the scenes' documentaries.  And they weren't released as a special edition at a later date.  On Cars, it's about 15 minutes and includes NO `making of' content.  It's a good feature about John Lasseter's inspiration for the story.  Usually, there are features about story development, animation techniques and other insights into the creative process that follows the years of work involved in making these films.  The Incredibles had tons of  Behind the Scenes features as well as 2 commentary tracks with writers and animators, giving you over 6 hours of extra content.  Over these many films, I have come to know and love the creators as much or more than the films themselves. I was a lot more excited about purchasing this DVD than my kids were.  Pixar truly had captured the `magic' that used to be Disney Animation, even in the Walt-style `behind-the-scenes' features.  Then, Disney, who in recent years has given us `creative triumphs' such as Cinderella 2, Little Mermaid 2, Beauty and the Beast 2 and  Lion King 2 and 3, bought Pixar.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the first Pixar release since the Disney buyout is being sold for the same $20.00 price, with minimal content.  Disney is clearly going for bigger profits and ripping off fans of Pixar.  I certainly don't believe that Pixar would suddenly change direction and offer their fans less.  Disney doesn't deserve a 5 star Amazon customer rating for such a lame product.  You don't have to hate the movie to rate this `release' as being poor.  I'm personally casting this as my vote AGAINST  Nemo 2, 3 & 4 or A Bugs Life: The Grasshoppers Return!

review/summary: Nice cartoon but nothing spectacular
review/text: This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.  In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.  He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.  Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.  There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.  All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.

review/summary: The Moose Hole - Life is a Highway
review/text: The courtship between the Walt Disney Corporation and Pixar Animation Studios has been at best a tumultuous one to say the least about it. Former-Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner deserves most of the blame however. He and Steve Jobs, Chairman/CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, were at each other's throats throughout their nearly decade long partnership together. Even after the astonishing break-out success of honorary Oscar recipient Toy Story in 1995, Eisner had yet to be convinced of Pixar's potential. Rather then buy Pixar straight-out, which would have been the smart and economically efficient thing to do, Disney instead negotiated to extend their three-picture distribution deal to five movies. Things became even direr after Disney theatrically released Toy Story 2 in 1999 which had been originally produced with the intention of it premiering direct-to-video. Pixar believed it should count as part of their five-picture deal with Disney but Eisner argued that it was negotiated outside of their contract and did not count. Disney's efforts to (no pun intended) drown Finding Nemo in the midst of the summer season, which failed miserably as it went on to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, surpassing The Lion King, further emboldened Jobs to seek a corporate divorce, if only to rid himself of Michael Eisner. Disaster was averted however when Michael Eisner chose, forcefully or not, to step down from his position aboard the Walt Disney Company allowing his replacement, Robert Iger, to woe Pixar back to Disney. With Eisner now out of the picture, Jobs, with no contention against the Disney Corporation anymore, agreed to sell the animation giant to the company for seven-billion dollars, far more then it would have been had Eisner chosen to buy them out ten years ago.  The story for Cars can easily be identified as the source of the movie's problems but precisely pinpointing the exact cause is a bit more difficult. While there is nothing particularly wrong with it per say - it is sweet and well meaning - it comes off as being far too generic. This is the exact same predicament the Brad Bird directed Pixar project, The Incredibles, was faced with two years ago. However, The Incredibles was in the end still able to be overtly entertaining in spite of this tremendous handicap. Cars, on the other hand, is not nearly as successful as its predecessor was. Time is not a factor, at least not on its face. Cars' one-hundred and fourteen minute time-length is on par with the running time for The Incredibles and yet Cars is the one that feels more drawn out. Lightning's trip to California, for example. While it does successfully `show off' Pixar's artistic prowess (emphasis added), it does nothing to better accommodate the flow of the story. Instead it smacks of pride and daresay smugness on the part of Pixar Animation and should have been shortened down. Even Lightning's community service sentence in Radiator Springs feels force fed. That said however Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway' is put to expedient use in this scene. And then unlike past Pixar films there is no distinctive villain to help chart the path of the film's protagonist. But then again this fails to explain Finding Nemo's success in terms of plot and character development. Regardless of what the true source of the problems is, Cars in spite of foreseeable plot devices still remains a cut above the rest of the mainstream box office.  The decision to cast comedic-actor Owen Wilson as the lead in Disney/Pixar's Cars did not bring quite the level of anticipation or enthusiasm as Craig T. Nelson for The Incredibles or Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo had in their respected roles. In spite of his fairly consistent appearance in such artistic independent films as The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums for director Wes Anderson, Wilson is judged mostly on his more frequent appearance in low-level comedies like Shanghai Knights, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Wedding Crashers which make the choice to cast him as the lead in a Pixar film a bit odd. Slowly but surely Wilson proves he is up to the challenge. Furthermore, there is more to the character makeup of Lightening McQueen then what lies on the surface. French political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous political analysis Democracy in America warned of the greatest threat facing the newborn nation America and its principles of liberty, freedom and democracy - individualism. Not the rugged individualism which vastly shaped this nation's western frontier throughout the 1800s but rather the individualism which leads people only to think of themselves and withdraw further from the community at large. It is the kind of `no-fault freedom' Senator Rick Santorum describes in his book It Takes a Family as the ability to "check out from the pursuit of the common good and to do what feels right for me, without regard to those around me". It is a bit of stretch, true, to go from discussing high-level political-science canon to a children's film about a world entirely inhabited by living, breathing cars. Regardless, the basic principle remains the same. Younger children will likely not pick up on the social-political implications of the message this film expresses just yet, maybe a few years down the road - if they are being educated properly, but adults will. Their embrace of the film and its message will make all the difference.  Cars will likely be one of the last, if not THE last, films for fellow car enthusiast and acting legend Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). He definitely goes out in style as the abrupt doctor of a simple town who hides a secret past. Say what you want about Larry the Cable Guy, even ardent fans would agree that his feature film debut, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, was a bit of an embarrassment, but there's no denying the fact that he steals the show with his hick antics as Mater which is just like "tuh-mater, but without the `tuh'".  Few will likely notice without examining the cast list first that Michael Keaton (Batman, Mr. Mom, White Noise, Herbie: Fully Loaded, etc.) is the voice of the quasi-villain, or as close to a villain as the film gets, Chick Hicks. Kudos both to the casting director and especially to Keaton himself who disguises his voice brilliantly in order to create a rather suspicious character.  And hearing Formula One-winner Michael Schumacher as well as NASCAR legends Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Darrell Waltrip, and Richard Petty, along with his wife, Lynda, provide the voices of their motor-vehicle counterparts in the film is definitely a surprising added bonus. Even car enthusiast/late-night talk-show host Jay Leno gets in on the act making a very brief cameo as Jay Limo early in the movie.  Overall, Cars, the seventh computer-animated project from the creative and talented folks at Pixar Animation Studios, not to mention their very last film before the Disney buyout, is sadly their worst to date. This is more of an insult to the movie industry overall however. Even on their worst day Pixar still manages to produce a product that is superior then the majority of what is out in the market right now - animated or otherwise. Optimistically, it's about average. While some pessimists will be quick to label Cars as a step backward for the company and ultimately a failure, alternatively it can be said that director John Lassester, intentionally or not, successfully reintroduces the basic storytelling principles and heart which he himself installed in the company with Toy Story and A Bug's Life in 1995 and 1998 respectively as it makes the transition from an independent entity into another cog in the Disney machine. It is difficult to pin down precisely what is wrong with this film. For one it felt as the though the level of anticipation for this film was no where near as high as it should have been for a Pixar release in summer when everyone is out of school. Marketing may be to blame for dropping the ball on this one, at least in part. Cars was sold too much to the male-driven (no pun intended) NASCAR crowd that it practically alienated the female demographic. That said however it is not entirely marketing's fault. While it is not beyond reason to believe that children or even some adults for that matter may wonder what toys do when humans are not around or whether fish and bugs talk, it is quite a stretch to believe that someone out there truly wants to know what the world would be like if it was entirely inhabited by cars. And unlike fish, toys, monsters, and, yes, even bugs, cars are just not cuddly. It is therefore practically impossible to sell a love story to young girls when it is between two cold pieces of metal, essentially. In addition there is nothing in Cars - visually or otherwise - that really sticks out in your mind when you leave the theatre. Sure, the scene with Mater and Lighting sneaking into the field to go `tractor tipping' is cute and all but it's nothing compared to the scene in Finding Nemo with Dory speaking whale or Mike and Sulley `practicing' for the company musical called `Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me' from Monsters, Inc. Not to be so negative about Cars, there are some bright spots. Randy Newman returns to Pixar in top form with an incredible accompanying musical score. And the soundtrack to the film has to be one of the best in the studios' history. It features excellent new additions like Sheryl Crow's `Real Gone' and `Find Yourself' from country artist Brad Paisley as well as some classic tunes like `Route 66' performed by Chuck Berry and Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway'. Cars is no where near the disaster some had predicted it would be but neither is it the best we could have hoped for.

review/summary: Lame marketing plot
review/text: My rage isn't against the movie, because it's excellent. Just read all the other reviews posted here.  My anger is against the reason behind this DVD's marketing strategy. Why in this world this thieves at Disney didn't include an English and Spanish audio tracks in the same DVD, or at least included Spanish subtitles along with the English track. They didn't do it because they wanted to squeeze more money out from their loyal customers, and force them to buy two copies of the same movie, one in English and one in Spanish.  I never go to the movies at the theater because mi wife doesn't understand English. I usually wait for the DVD release and buy it for the enjoyment of the movie at my home, playing it in my already expensive home theater system. Thus, if a movie doesn't have Spanish (audio or subtitles) I simply don't buy it. But I had to buy this one because my kids.  My kids and I do speak English and we watch the DVD with English audio, given my kids prefer it that way. But when I watch the movie together with my wife we do it with Spanish audio or at least with Spanish subtitles (yes, I commonly watch movies twice). This time, with Cars' DVD, my wife was left out the enjoyment, of course, unless I buy the Spanish version.  I've bought every DVD Disney has produced and sold in the past 5 years, but a rip off like this makes me think in piracy as an option.... Did you hear that Disney?

Pixar's usually pretty good right?  Both of us at one point looked at each other about half way through to figure out what time it was.  The film has great messages and wonderful animation but the execution is really flat and boring.  Pixar is noteable for being exceptional, something that's hard to do with animated films that will be appealing to both kids and adults.  It's enjoyable for the most part but this clearly is the first of the Pixar films to fall noticeably short.

review/summary: Quality animation, but boring movie.
review/text: My husband and I saw this movie in the theater.  We were really surprised by how unentertaining we found it, and I must point out that my husband is a real animation fanatic.  He would go to any and all animated movies in the theater if I would go along, which I usually won't.  We got suckered into this one by some positive reviews on TV.  I'm sorry to say we laughed once and I looked at my watch a lot because I found it draggy.  Maybe OK as a family-friendly film, but certainly not on a level with Shrek, Toy Story, Little Mermaid, etc.  Nice animation, but it takes a little more than that to keep my attention; celebrity voices don't do it for me either. I sometimes wonder if the people who write these movies would work a little harder if they didn't have well-known people doing the voices - it seems like they think people will watch the movie just because Paul Newman or whoever is doing a voice.  I also think the people who make this type of movie feel that because there are so few quality family/children's movies that they can put anything they want on the screen and people will go to see it because they need something to take the kids to.  Anyway...my husband and I agreed that it's unlikely we would watch it twice.

I hate it when there are talking cars. Cars aren't meant to talk. They are meant to drive and stop when supposed to without talking. This is my opinion. Just because you don't think this is right doesn't mean it's not helpful. Be kind.

review/summary: Time for a car wash...
review/text: I have a huge problem with this movie.  As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.  It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.  UGH, I hate this movie.  The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.  The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).  In a word, this film is just `boring'.

review/text: We normally love Pixar films.  For instance, thought The Incredibles was, well Incredible.  Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 1&2 were great, so were excited when the new Pixar film came out.  We didn't catch it in the theater, so when Christmas came around, we asked for, and got it.  A couple nights ago, there was nothing interesting on TV, so we decided to put in Cars.  We got about halfway through, after laughing a couple of times--tractor tipping--, but then turned it off.  I'm not a big NASCAR fan, but I thought, "Hey, it's Pixar.  They can make anything fun."  I guess we should have checked it out of the library first, before deciding if we wanted to add it to our collection.  Now I think the library can add it to theirs.....  Don't bother with this movie.

The terrible crash scene, out running a train, trying to get another vehicle to crash...that's as far as I got and I shut it off.  I am dissappointed that in todays world this is okay for our children to see.  Not my kids.......I will throw it away...

review/summary: Dull as Dishwater - a review of "Cars"
review/text: No one in our family liked this movie.  Mom and Dad didn't like it and neither did our 4 and 6 year olds (boy and girl) -- and we are pretty easy to entertain.  I mean we liked the Curious George movie so how hard are we to amuse?!?!?  First:  the movie is overly long (or conversely under plotted) Second: the characterization is missing.  Flat, flat, flat. (The best characters were Tow-mater and the little Italians.  But the two main characters were boring and forgettable.) Third:  wasn't Ellen DeGeneres available to do the voice-over or did she turn it down after looking at the script.  As with most kid material, I look to my children's reactions in order to gage how to rate something.  In the case of "Cars" I have to say that my two children fidgeted and actually had to be walked about the lobby to reduce the tedium.  It was either that or leave!  My daughter, btw, will sit through 2 hours of a Wagner opera so what does that say about the low entertainment value of this movie!?!?  Two Stars.  Though the animation quality was top-notch, this was no NEMO, or even Thomas the Tank Engine when it comes to storyline interest.  Buy if you are desperate for rainy day fair, otherwise my small fry advise giving it a miss.

review/summary: Marketing NASCAR to children
review/text: The car race industry is very good at cultivating new customers at an early age.  I wonder if the producers of "Cars" received some money from the business.  Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids.  How much of a movie  like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy?  I thought "Finding Nemo" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters).  I gave "Cars" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it.  For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend "Mothering" magazine.  They review all sorts of good movies, CDs and books to entertain and educate young people.

review/summary: Like A Typical Race, A Pleasant "Cars" Follows A Very Routine And Expected Track
review/text: I really wanted to love "Cars"! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless, I've actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record. "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," and "The Incredibles" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And "Toy Story 2" and "Monsters, Inc." are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.  But, alas, I was a bit let down with "Cars." It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no "real" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.  "Cars" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like "Life Is A Highway" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.  Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing "Cars," did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, "Cars" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06.

review/summary: Very cute and entertaining movie
review/text: I love Pixar films, they are always poignant, yet funny, not to mention the animation is awesome.  While Cars is not my favorite Pixar movie, it was still entertaining and fun to watch.  Lightning McQueen is a flashy and selfish race car on his way to California to race in the big Piston Cup race and while on the highway his ride (a Mack truck called "Mack"heh) falls asleep and somehow the ramp drops down and lets a sleeping McQueen out onto the highway.  While Mack continues on his way oblivious McQueen is not on board, McQueen suddenly realizes that he can't find his ride and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.  He speeds around looking for Mack and unfortunately, gets a police car from a small town of Radiator Springs off route 66, on his tail.  He gets in trouble and ends up having to serve a community service sentence by fixing the road into town that he messed up in his police car chase.  McQueen isn't too happy about this as he's supposed to be in California for the race in a week, but the town leader, Doc Hudson (who presided over his case as judge) is adamant he serve his sentence and McQueen is resigned to his unlucky fate.  I thought there were a lot of funny parts in the movie and I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes.  Instead of "cow tipping", there is "tractor tipping", and the scene where McQueen and Tow Mater (a rusty tow truck) decide to go tractor tipping was hilarious.  Another funny moment was when the 2 Italian cars that owned the local tire store, and their love of all things Ferrari, finally meet a real life Ferrari (their reactions were so cute!).  I loved the message in the movie.  That fame, fortune, and looking out for number one isn't what life is all about, that the love and companionship of friends and family is far more lasting.  It was heart-warming to see the change in the brash Lightning McQueen, as the town of Radiator Springs and its locals, slowly effect his outlook on life.  He begins to realize what is really important vs. what he thought was important before in his flashy race car life.  The ending fit into this theme of what really matters in life, winning no matter what or realizing winning isn't everything (Oh, be sure to continue watching after credits roll, there are scenes after the ending showing what happens after the race).  This is a fun-filled movie, with some humorous moments, and while not the best Pixar movie I've seen it was still a good one.  I don't think I've ever seen a bad Pixar movie. =)

Lightning McQueen: How do you mean? Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through the land like that interstate. It moved with the land, it rose, it fell, and it curved. Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. "  'Route 66, Get Your Kicks on Route 66'- remember that song that solidified the reason for driving to the west on that great highway? As we all knew, the interstates took over and Route 66 is driven only for pleasure, now. Wait a minute, isn't that what driving and vacations are supposed to be?  I am usually not an animated film fan, but I think I have been through a conversion, If I wanted to understand my three year old grandaughters fascination with someone called 'Lighting McQueen' I realized I had better get with it. She and I watched this movie, and I fell in love with the story, the animation, the color, the depiction, the soundtrack and the characters. Sally and Lighting' McQueen, Mater, and Doc. Who could better convey life's lessons than these cars in a movie directed towards all of us? Not only is this a knock-out movie but it kept my interest for two hours. My granddaughter told me "there are some scary parts, gramma, but they go by fast', and she was correct. The Director knows his stuff and the animators and illustrators and the entire kit and caboodle put together a story so well done that this is a must see.  he cast of characters could not be better, what voices, what style, they convey the feel of the story with such joie de vive.  Owen Wilson .... Lightning McQueen (voice) Paul Newman .... Doc Hudson (voice) Bonnie Hunt .... Sally Carrera (voice) Larry The Cable Guy .... Mater (voice) Cheech Marin .... Ramone (voice) Tony Shalhoub .... Luigi (voice) Guido Quaroni .... Guido (voice) Jenifer Lewis .... Flo (voice) Paul Dooley .... Sarge (voice) Michael Wallis .... Sheriff (voice) George Carlin .... Fillmore (voice) Katherine Helmond .... Lizzie (voice) John Ratzenberger .... Mack/Hamm Truck/Abominable Snow Plow/P.T. Flea Car (voice) Joe Ranft .... Red/Peterbilt (voice) Michael Keaton .... Chick Hicks (voice)  The theme of the movie is winning at any cost and life's little diversions that teach us well. Lighting McQueen is the star, but each and every character is integral to the plot and the movie. We all know that we can't have everything, but a little bit is ok!  The soundtrack was scored by Randy Newman and it is fabulous. The music lifted me up and I recognized Randy Newman's stamp all over. Rascal Flatts sings the hit "Life Is a Highway," The highlight is Sheryl Crow's "Real Gone". John Mayer sings the theme "Route 66", and Chuck Berry's version is also included. "Opening Race," and "Bessie" does George Thorogood a turn. Randy Newman delivers a wonderful song in" Our Town," sung by James Taylor. The soundtrack is available on CD.  The Director, "Lasseter tells Michele Norris how the idea for the film grew out of a two-month summer trip he took with his family after working nonstop during the 1990s. During that time, he directed the box-office hits A Bug's Life and both Toy Story movies, and served as executive producer for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. "I learned that the journey in life is a reward," he says. "It's about living every day to its fullest, and I knew that's what I wanted the film to be about." Lasseter talks about Cars, the challenges of directing an animated film, and how technological advances have -- and haven't -- affected his work. NPR, Morning Edition  'Cars' is one of those movies that you tell friends about, urge them to see, by the DVD for family, and even promote this movie to your children. So highly recommended. prisrob 01/01/06

review/summary: No Booster Seats Required For This Car Ride
review/text: Cars is another Disney Pixar success. It succeeds in warming the heart; it makes you appreciate the value of friends and family; and it continues the tradition of teaching good morals. It's a class-A family film.  The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.  There has been a tremendous proliferation of computer generated films over the past couple of years which has certainly diluted the excitement that used to surround these movies. 2006 has got to set the record with 13...count 'em...13 releases that I can think of (Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, Hoodwinked, The Ant Bully, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away).  And perhaps that is why I was a bit tentative going into Cars. Or perhaps it was because I just didn't think a movie about car racing and cars-come-to-life could be as enjoyable as the Disney Pixar films that preceded Cars. I should have known better.  Cars is another in Disney Pixar's unblemished track record of delivering the epitome of a wonderful family classic.  Here's a little trivia: John Ratzenburger appears (rather, his voice does) in all (Toy Story [1995], A Bug's Life [1998], Toy Story 2 [1999], Monsters, Inc [2001], Finding Nemo [2003], The Incredibles [2004] & Cars [2006]) of the Disney Pixar releases to date, and there's a little tribute to this at the end of Cars during the rolling credits.  Cars is a very good movie that's well worth the purchase.

I love the music and voice acting Pixar put together as well.  Click and Clack, the Tapert brothers from NPR as the Rusteeze owners was an especially nice touch.  The plot of the film is kid friendly but also takes adults back to the time when people drove cars to drive cars and meet people, not get somewhere.  Now the occasional car meet at the local drive in diner (if any are left in your town) is about all that is left of this culture.  Cars reminds us all of that time not long ago.

review/summary: An Interesting Concept And A Brilliant Movie By Pixar
review/text: Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.  I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.  Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.  I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.
