review/summary: Ironman proves there are heroes beyond Spidey and Superman
review/text: This is a great entertainer done very well. But how does Ironman compete so well with the Spidey and Superman films that have already established a following? Ans:  With a great script, catchy dialouges and funny one-liners. You'll get enough of them throughout the movie.  Great chemistry between co-stars. Particularly between Robert Downey Jr and Gwenyth Paltrow, particularly in the gadget inserting scene, and at the party. The pair is so good they give the Clark Kents-Louis Lanes and Peter Parkers-MJ's a run for their money. 3. Decent special effects -This movie doesn't dethrone Spidey and Superman films but you will not be disappointed. The scene showing Ironman breaking the sound barrier on his trip to the village in Afghanistan where he rescues a village from the terrorists was a stroke of a genius. This is something that the Superman movies didn't think of in all these years. The action isn't bad too. 3. Many funny scenes - However one of them topped them all. This is the one where Tony is enjoying the wine and trying to look at the stewardesses dancing and at same time trying to pretend he is communicating with his friend who is completely vexed and frustrated trying to get his attention. Earlier in a picture bio, Tony is shown with Bill Gates. That was a nice one too.  I wonder why the linguist behind the film made the terrorists speak both Hindi and another language. Jeff Bridges does a good job. Robert Downey Junior makes a great comeback and Gwenyth does a pleasant job as the secretary. Except for one small scene that can be passed off lightly, this movie can be watched by your kids too.  Sans Ozzie's vocals, it was great to hear the riffs from Black Sabbath's "IronMan" at the end of the movie.  If you left the cinema hall during the end-credits, at the end of the end-credits, Samuel L Jackson appears and confronts Tony Stark indicating to us that a sequel is in the making. Not to forget Tony's entry in the last minutes in "Incredible Hulk" movie. Something's brewing there too. I am sure we can expect more from him.

review/summary: Guilty Pleasue of a movie!
review/text: I have never been a comic book guy, and super hero movies are seldom high on my "I got to see that" list. However due to the almost universal praise of this film by reviewers that I have come to trust, I gave it a try and got the Amazon Video on demand purchase last weekend. I got the Hulk on a rental for the above listed reasons, and quite liked it as well, and was happy I watched it first, to get the tie in of Tony Stark industries...  In any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a "Comic Book GUY" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well. So why does a comic book work as a movie? It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love. It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil. And how any evil thing we do may come back to bite us in the backside, no matter the motives.  Also... Iron man is a fun movie with wonderful CG's a very cool visual experience. So, leave your disbelief at the door, and enjoy this very fun ride of a movie! 4 1/2*

review/summary: Robert Downey Jr. actually does it as a superhero
review/text: I think that movie makers have to wait till the technology is there to produce a certain movie that might require sophisticated effects and not just wait for a good script and have the technology (if not mature enough) ruin the film.  George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too.  The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects.  Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.  Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen.

review/summary: A VERY SOLID SCREEN ADAPTATION
review/text: IRON MAN moved along at a break-neck pace, and for the most part, the plethora of CGI effects were never allowed to clobber some of the first-rate acting by Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. There was also some extremely funny dialogue, and excellent physical humor by Downey, who for my money, is far less wooden than most of the super heroes buzzing around screendom these days ( with the notable exception of Ron Perlman ). Fun stuff.

review/text: My husband rented Iron Man and watched it without me since I'm not a big movie person. After watching the film he said,"You have to watch this. It's great!' I thought, "Yeah, right" and that it would be another boring comic book movie. Well, I was wrong! Iron Man IS great. R.D. Jr. is terrific in the lead. The movie grabbed me from the first scene.

review/summary: Iron Man is it worth seeing again
review/text: From what i have seen Iron Man is a ok movie. It has a decent plot but the acting could have been better. It was a big buget movie but like I said the acting could have been better. Dont get me wrong it was a good movie all around movie. but i give it a four out of five stars.  Iron man started out really slow. This was supposed to be a action movie but, the action didnt start until the middle of the movie. when the action came in it was when he ws braking out of the cave in the desert.  alot of people thought that it was goign to be just another crapy marvel movie like fantastic four it was actually really good.

review/text: This is one of the few movies I've seen in theaters in recent years. I was entertained and impressed by the level of story, bringing back much of the joy of the Iron Man comic books I read when young. The action and CGI use wasn't merely there because they could do it; it was integral to the story development and contributed to the wild ride. The DVD's extras are great, explaining all the actors went through in preparation for the movie. Robert Downey, Jr. had to learn a different type of wire use as the director didn't want it to look like Peter Pan. It works well. I was eager to see the DVD and I wasn't disappointed in the least.

review/summary: Robert Downey Jr IS Iron Man!
review/text: I haven't read any of the comic books of Iron Man, so I came into this as something of a blank slate. I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. "How perfect," I thought. "Bound not to be much of a stretch for him."  Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.  You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.  It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.  There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.

review/summary: It's time...
review/text: To consider Comic Book character Movies as a serious genre.  I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.  With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.  But I digress.  Let's talk Iron Man.  Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.  Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.  Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.

review/text: Iron Man breathes new life into the Marvel movie universe.While most marvel movies nowadays involve some young hero out trying to find himself while trying to save the city at the same time,Iron man takes a more sophisticated and more adult approach.While there is a considerable amount of time dedicated to Tony Starks's Ingenuity i.e. building suit prototypes,weapons aand ect, good filmaking and an excellent script make this a rather enjoyable process.Any doubts about Robert Downey's acting are put to rest by this movie,as this by far is one of the strongest performances of the year.Very suprising was the lack of sexual content and graphic violence which usually defines movies as "good" nowadays.Iron Man is a rare breed of action film in many respects,a lack of pointless and graphic material ensures that anyone in the family can enjoy this film and a good script and plot round out any beliefs about this film being yet another hormone driven teenage flop.

review/summary: You've got to have heart, Tony Stark does/did/does
review/text: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) military/industrial weapons mogul just finished demonstrating his newest rocket in the Middle East, when he is purloined by ruthless locals with dirty faces and a penchant for power. Who could be behind the dastardly deed? Of course everyone knows it is the last person you would suspect as in any good mystery.  Well as luck would have it, in Starks efforts to escape he invents the fundamental technology for, you guessed it, Ironman. In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon. How can he correct his faux pax?  In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)  For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.  For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.  It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.  Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility. I am pretty sure future versions will add more insight or at least more footage. The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray]

review/summary: The Marvel Man-Machine
review/text: In summers that are now filled with super heroes vying for cinematic dollars, Iron Man climbs to the top of the mountain, with the human side of the story not being overwhelmed by high-tech gadgetry.  With a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists. Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the "Avenger Initiative".  This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time.

review/summary: Great Entertainment, Good Story, Fascinating Techie Stuff
review/text: I've heard both good and not so great comments about Iron Man. Let me toss in mine. Tony Stark is a Mcgyverish, haunted James Bond. If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.  From a female point of view, the machines, effects and equipment were cool and not overly technical to the point I lost interest. Techie geeks may have issues with the details, so read a techie focused review if you fit that category. The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace. Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.  The language is pretty clean. I either missed some or was caught up enough into the story that it didn't grate against my ears. Downey plays an anti/super-hero like he was born to play it. The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films. Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.  Sensitive parents may want to take note of the playboy Stark who has a quick, not too subtle romp with a female reporter. Iron Man is not as squeaky clean as the traditional superhero films (think Peter Parker). Violence isn't gory as much as shoot-em-up. Kids in danger might be frightening for some children and a scene in the car with soldiers is sad and might bother some who have soldiers currently serving.

review/summary: Tony Stark Rocks the Planet
review/text: Okay, let me just say, that this is the best Marvel Adaptation I have seen since Spiderman 2, and to have it immediately followed by the new Hulk movie just about made this the best year for superhero movies.  And the very thought of those two characters, Iron Man and the Hulk, crossing over, is sooooooooo exciting I can barely contain myself.  Now for the nitty-gritty:  Some people, including myself, have questioned the choice of Robert Downey Jr playing Stark.  When I saw, ages ago, that he would be the title character, I was kind of surprised.  Downey, it seems to me, has been flying low under the radar lately.  With Iron Man he explodes onto the scene, and, as far as I can see, blows the skeptics away.  Gwyneth as Pepper Potts? A surprise, I never expect to see her in supporting roles, but in this one she looked good.  (and, as an aside, at a healthier weight than I think I have ever seen)  Jeff Bridges:  Most Excellent, per usual, but if you have a pet peeve with word pronounciation you won't like his treatment of 'manufactured'.  Like I said, definitely the best superhero movie from Marvel that I have seen in a long time.  And The Incredible Hulk is an impressive companion, so I hope when it comes out on DVD they sell them in sets!!  I highly reccommend it, it's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket or rental fee and even purchasing the DVD.

The turning point was when my own father (who's around 60) went to the film and liked it! I then said, "I've got to see this one now!"  I am glad I did! While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans! Robert Downey, Jr. definitely had Tony Stark down cold! A selfish industrialist who is forced to change his ways and outlook on life after an attack leaves his body shattered and forces him to create the machine that would become his "costume" for justice as Iron Man.  Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters. I've personally never thought of Paltrow as hot but she did change my mind with the shape she got herself in for this film! HMMM!  Back to the movie, this isn't a waste of money. That's for sure!

review/summary: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing
review/text: Iron Man works on many levels--as an action movie with lots of explosions, fights, and great special effects--but also a sophisticated comedy poking fun at the genre--or finally a character driven drama that explores complex and conflicted characters. Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark. He could almost be playing himself, except for the arms merchant part. It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs. But his checkered past gives him just the edge to play the jaded Stark:  --------------------------- Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: [walking in on Stark's robots trying to get him out of the Iron Man suit] What is going on here? Tony Stark: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing. Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: Are those bullet holes? +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  According to an interview, Downey got off the drugs after an epiphany involving a cheeseburger from Burger King. An interesting parallel developed in Iron Man where Tony Stark was captured in a foreign land, then when he escaped and got back on US soil, the first thing he craved was a cheeseburger. Product placement? Perhaps, but what could be more American? Someone said after Elvis died that it was as if there would suddenly be no more cheeseburgers. Of course, Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) also love pizza from New York. One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).  Robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:  ------------------------------ Christine Everheart: Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions? Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute. Tony Stark: [whispers to Hogan] She's alright? [turns around] Tony Stark: Hi! Christine Everheart: Hi. Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay, go. Christine Everheart: You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that? Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint. Christine Everheart: And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death? Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley? Christine Everheart: Brown, actually. Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals. Christine Everheart: Rehearse that much? Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime. Christine Everheart: I can see that. Tony Stark: I'd like to show you firsthand. =================================================  Jon Favreau did a great job of directing. Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit. He's come a long way since 'Swingers' but I noticed right away his obvious talent. He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget! This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury. The teenage traumas and dramas of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) made it all signify something, which was quite a feat, considering it was a movie based on toys. 'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat. In the tsunami of Super Hero/comic book blockbusters, it really stands out. Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects. In 'Iron Man' there are plenty of examples of machines becoming more human--and vice versa. The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit? Or how about the other way around, when he talks to his machines as if they were people? There is a robotic arm that follows him around, eager to do his bidding. When he chastises it for being over zealous, it droops in despair that is so human and familiar.  Oh, yeah, that reminds me. When Tony Stark is working with his machines and computers he is listening to "Institutionalized" by Suicidal Tendencies. Pepper Potts comes in and turns it down and he yells at her as if she were his mom. There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name. Finally, as the credits roll, we get to hear that fabulous riff. Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film. Whether it is a new or old version, according to the credits, it is performed by Black Sabbath. After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.

Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!  GREAT!

review/text: Alright, I am not here to take you through a step by step synopsis of the movie. I have been reading Marvel comics for as long as I remember and have basically experienced the rise and fall of their illustrious movie career. I lost faith after Spidey 3 and Ghost Rider and when I heard Iron Man was coming out I nearly hung myself. I watched it last night and I nearly cried for Marvel has redeemed itself finally. The movie was awesome, the dialog was snappy and the fact that they did not concentrate on the armor was excellent also. And when they mentioned S.H.I.E.L.D at the end, I jumped for joy because Marvel finally incorporated another part of their universe into one of their movies. Now my faith in Marvel has been restored and you know what, I started collecting and reading comic books again. I feel the fan boy coming back and I love it. I hope they don't massacre the sequel and I pray they don't massacre the Avengers, Thor and the Punisher War Zone. FANBOYS UNITE!!!!

review/summary: "I need a scotch. I'm starving."
review/text: Robert Downey Jr. doesn't strike the average viewer as superhero material, which is probably why IRON MAN works so magnificently. Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.  Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of  for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.  In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.  This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.

review/summary: Warning: I know absolutely nothing about the comic book--but I still liked this!
review/text: Yes, I am one of those irritating people who have never read the comic (sorry, but I am simply not a comic reader--more so because I never had the opportunity to become addicted) and had barely heard of Iron Man until I saw the trailor for this very movie back in the day.  So... my review will be based simply on my impressions of the movie with no reference to Marvel or comic anything else.  Because I don't know any of that.  To begin, this is a fantastic movie.  I don't know enough about movie making to disect the details, but I like to think I can avoid the truly terrible and I do know what I like.  So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs:  good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.  Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.  And that is because what truly got me was the theme.  I'm not a fan of war (I don't think anyone truly is) and there was something about the whole fight-for-peace thing that got to me--and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.  Sue me, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.  So this theme leads into a delightfully action-y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain-killing.  The cast is SUPERB. I can't think of anyone else I could get to play a part in this assortment of characters.  And these characters?  A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite "fun" feel.  Wonderful combination.  And I can't get over how the screen sizzles when Downey and Paltrow have a scene together. And they never even kiss. That is a testament against all those that think rampant sex is the only way to show passion on the silver screen.  Apparently this movie was enough to please someone who does not read comics.  It has the action, romance, and heart to make a quality movie.

review/summary: A Triumphant Blend of Action and Character.
review/text: "Iron Man" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than "Spiderman" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's "Batman" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  As the first film in the franchise, "Iron Man" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work "mediocre", but I have to admit that "Iron Man" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.  The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which "Iron Man" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.

I knew Dark Knight was going to be good but this one...oh man.  I didn't want to see it in theaters for fear of disappointment, but upon buying the DVD, I regret not seeing it on the big screen.  Robert Downey Jr is just the best Stark for this movie.  I am simply speechless as to what else to add to this review except that it was worth the 23 dollars for the 2 disc and I wish I had a Blu Ray player to experience this movie the right way.

review/summary: great movie
review/text: I've never really read much of the iron man comic. I limit myself to a few titles because if left unrestrained I would go into debt via comic shop.  So I can't attest to the authenticity of character portrayal. Though friends who do read the comic say it's close enough.  With all that, in my opinion, this movie was a great super hero movie. I really loved the two new Batman movies but have heard some people argue that Begins was a little slow. And while I can see what they're talking about, it didn't seem boring to me.  Meaning: I like that they're doing these origin movies. Iron man could have been a flop but it wasn't. I looked at my watch afterwards and thought, holy crap, that was 2 hours!? There was absolutely no chance to be bored in this film.  The movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. I had my doubts about Downey Jr pulling off the role. And let's be honest, it was Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr. It was a perfect role for him. He made the character believable.  That I didn't realize time had passed is the best compliment I can give this movie. Unlike the Matthew Broderick Godzilla a few years back where I looked at my watch and realized it had only been twenty minutes into my suffering.  My copy of the DVD is on it's way to me so I can't attest to the special features. I'll try and review them when I've watched them.  If you haven't seen this movie, rent it and see. But I don't think you'll be disappointed. Buy it so they'll continue to make movies of this caliber.

review/text: I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days.  Instead I am going to give you all you need to know.  Go watch this film!  It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date.  Granted, the original story was "updated" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!  Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved.  You got this one right!  This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review/text: The thing that makes Iron Man great is that nobody expected to be great. I mean people were skeptical because Robert Downey Jr. hadnt been in a lead role for a decade so it was questioned if he would fare well or not. After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.  Brief spoilers: Tony Starks gets into a near fatal accident in a Middle Eastern country and is forced to build a weapon for some millitia group there. He builds his first Iron Man suit(which looks like the Iron Giant) and escapes from the terrorist group's clutches. He is found lying in the desert and returns home to say that he is through making weapons comes as a shock to everybody. Meanwhile there is something fishy going on with his longtime partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges).  Opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel. Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane. I like how they took time to show how Tony Starks tested his armor out before he decided to finally use it. I also like the fact that the movie sticks to the comic book without being cartoonish and silly. Iron Man was the first superhero movie to come out in 2008 and it unexpectedly set the bar high for superhero movies in 2008. Two thumbs all the way up.

The Christopher Reeve Superman's ummmm ya. Well the list goes on, but I think that this was one of the most faithful creations of a DC/Marvel comic movie conversion. Yes they did take a few liberty's but it's Hollywood what do you expect.  I think that Robert Downey Jr. was a good choice I just hope that he can stay out of trouble long enough to make the sequel they left the movie open for. Lot's of action in this movie some good CGI but yet not a slap you in the face CGI.

review/text: Im a huge comic book fan (just started reading them again recently) and especially love movies based on them. Ive only read one Iron man comic in my life and read other comics that include him with other heroes. But I knew I had to see this movie. Some doubted Downy JR as Tony Stark aka Iron Man because of his past. But he prooved everyone why he was perfect for the role.  This is on my list of the 5 best superhero movies of all time which includes Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Incredible Hulk and Blade.  I bought the 2 disc edition at Target which came in a different package. You get the box but the dvds itself come in a cool case that is shaped and looks like Iron Man's mask. Its the same price as this edition with the same special features but the only difference is the case.  The dvd is loaded with special features that include:  Deleted and Extended scenes (comes with the 1 disc edition as well but thats what it only has) Behind the scenes Still Galaries and so much more  This dvd is perfect for any fan of comics, especially of Iron Man, or if you just love super hero movies or just a fan of movies with tons of action and special effects. This dvd is perfect for anyone.

review/summary: It's Everything Iron Man Should Be
review/text: Some Summer movie fans thought that this film wouldn't come close to being a blockbuster like The Dark Knight.Well let me say that The Dark Knight was a confusing mess and this time DC Comics really dropped the ball.Iron Man was very well done.It stayed true to the origin story of why Tony Stark became Iron Man somewhat.In the comics he escaped out of Vietnam as a POW,in this adaptation it was in the Middle East. But that's a good thing because this film is set in the present time and it all makes sense in our world today. It is also a commentary that a man can change his ways and make a difference in the world. Faverau really avoided the fact that Tony was an alcoholic and was a greedy prick in most cases.The director did show Tony partying alot and drinking here and there.Iron Man is a great companion film to Incredible Hulk.It is best to watch Iron Man first and then Hulk because at the end of The Hulk Tony shows up and makes a comment eluding to the Avengers.In one scene you can see Captain America's shield in Tony's workshop.Jeff Bridges is in great shape for his age and plays the ultimate villain,a backstabber! Marvel is giving DC it's money's worth and is bringing the heat.Just a side comment if I may,but late 2008 and 2009's flicks are going to be awesome. Here's the lineup so far.Punisher:War Zone,Watchmen,GIJOE,Transformers 2:Revenge Of The Fallen,Wolverine,Terminator:Salvation and Superman:Man Of Steel.Marvel and DC have been at it for years over the summer box office.And that's okay because the fans are the real winners.So when you get Iron Man make sure you pre-order Hulk.And if your'e a comics nut like I am,you should get Dark Knight just for the hell of it,just because you'll be owning Heath Ledger's last complete role on film.

review/summary: Iron Man is simply an outstanding movie on every level
review/text: It's no wonder that everyone is praising Iron Man in some way. For me, Iron Man is the best origin movie ever made. It surpasses every original installment of any superhero film to date. It doesn't just manage to deliver a little bit of everything but it does it with style and integrity. Iron Man is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The mega talented cast fit each main character perfectly and the story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. The dialogue is witty and what humor there is works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. (No forced bachelor party dancing to set up a joke etc.) A couple of comic book style slugfests are included but inserted only as a vehicle for the story. Things aren't blown up just for the sake of seeing them go boom. What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about? This is truly moviemaking of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.

review/text: IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.

review/summary: The Best Superhero Movie So Far...
review/text: I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.  The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.  The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.  The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.  Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.  Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.  Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.  Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!

review/summary: Marvel Delivers a Winner This Time!!!
review/text: When the Comic inspired movies have been hit or miss lately,  Iron Man is a BIG hit.  After Daredevil,(awful) The Hulk bomb, Fantastic Four...eh, at least we got to see Jessica Alba, and even the last Spiderman came up really short, this was a very welcome surprise.  Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, as is Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow.  The story is very well executed. (Having never read Iron Man in my days of youth, I didn't have to waste 2 hours making sure the screenplay was exactly like the old comic.)  I imagine the film could have been longer in order to add more dimension and back story, but this delivered the goods, and I look forward to the sequel.  5 stars!

review/summary: The New "Golden Avenger" Standard for Superhero Films
review/text: I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my "giddies" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;  THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....   Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing "Star Wars" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even "Lord of the Rings" got me this stoked (and I love that series).  I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; "I hate CGI".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( "Zathura" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.  THIS FILM ROCKS!!   Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!  I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first "Iron" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy  THIS FILM ROCKS!!! OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.  Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.  THIS FILM RO.... That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an "Avengers" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in "Iron Man" we are all in for a real treat!!  A WORD TO PARENTS There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids  Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.

review/summary: Completely Stunned That I Liked the Movie
review/text: If not for my mother being hell bent on seeing this movie on Mother's Day, I probably would've never seen it. I'm not big on superheroes, fighting crime, and action movies (unless it involves speeding cars), but I sat through this movie patiently to please my mother. However, somewhere along the line, it stopped being about my mother, and the movie grabbed my interest. This movie took an interesting spin in an updated way by making the plot about a weapon's expert who originally made products to fight against terrorists, but when he was captured as a war prisoner and forced to make weapons for the terrorists, the expert had to figure out how to escape. His escaping escapade led him to perfect the Iron Man suit (full of humorous scenes) and find out that back in America, there were some sneaky issues going on with his business and personal life around him. I enjoyed the sarcastic comments and dry wit of the Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character, and of course, Terrence Howard's character was as smooth and charismatic as Howard is in every movie. The very beginning was interesting, then the next 20 minutes were slow, and the movie picked up after that and took off. I'm surprised to say I'd go see it again because I enjoyed the action, plus I loved the costume!

review/summary: He Who Flies With the Most Toys
review/text: The Good Things *Smashing special effects and action scenes. *Good, straightforward filming style.  A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth. *Very good, sleek production designs and costumes. *Pretty good, straightforward story.  Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance. *Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious). *Pretty good characters; pretty good acting.  In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.  Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero. *Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again! *Great sound effects. *Awesome music.  The Bad Things *One or two slow parts.  The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it.  But it's still not too dull at all.  Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.  Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.  The characters are not too shabby.  The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.  Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing), I would say that it is better.  It's still not extremely deep or profound, but is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."

review/summary: The best comic book superhero movie adaptation to date.
review/text: Okay, you've heard tons of reviews about how awesome the movie is.  Its like a Disneyland ride, you see it the first time and its exciting- but you want to go back to see it again, because you know you missed some stuff.  My husband and I have already been back to see the movie a second time- and yes, we will be going to see it again the theaters.  But if you are into the comics, then you wanna know how close this is to the comic book. And let me tell you, being that this is a Marvel produced movie (instead of studio produced) they took care of their baby.  Some time ago they updated the Iron Man comic from the 60's version, of Iron Man being in Vietnam, to the Middle East.  The movie further adapts it to fit the current goings on in the world.  This detail doesn't take away from the story at all.  In fact, the movie is so close to the comic book, that its obvious the care Marvel took in keeping true to Iron Man and Tony Stark.  The only problem we found was in the Jarvis representation, but it didn't take away from the story either.  There was still the playful interaction some readers come to love between Tony and Jarvis.  The 10 rings is addressed, but not fully fleshed out.  But that's what Iron Man 2 is for; seeing as this was Iron Man, and Tony Stark's introduction to the movie fan.  Favreau did an excellent job weaving this story, and making it understandable, even if you aren't into the comics- without making the comic book read feel as if the story is being dumbed down.  Its not, not at all!  He is a brilliant director, and did a fantastic job.  Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man/Tony Stark- he really IS Tony Stark and its so excellent, he's funny, and charming.. which makes it obvious exactly why Tony Stark is the ladies man he is; he was born to play this role, and Terrence Howard will be FANTASTIC as War Machine in the next film!  I hope to see Happy and Pepper together in the next film, and I hope that Tony's alcoholism plays a bigger part in the next film, as its been something he struggled with during the comics.  But this is all stuff you wouldn't expect to be overwhelmed with in the first movie, but want to see in the second film.  There is not a single boring moment.  The movie is fast paced, and takes you on an excellent ride.  The after credit scene had me howling, and will probably have every Marvel fan howling as well- so make sure you stick around for it.

review/summary: Iron Man Is Sensational, Best Comic Book Adaptation I've Seen
review/text: While I'll admit that I haven't been a fan of Marvel Comics "Iron Man" series, this big screen adaptation of this fan favorite is absolutely sensational. Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near-fatal encounter with Afghani terrorists literally leads him towards a new path in life. The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely - and brilliant - assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as Stark's complicated business partner Obediah Stane. Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow. Of course the special effects are absolutely top notch, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic.

review/summary: Don't Miss this One!
review/text: Not being a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, I thought this movie would be bad.  On the contrary.  This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).  Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.  The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.  It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.  Warning - Make sure you stay past the end of the credits or you will miss an important few minutes of added story that will set up the movie continuation and also introduce a familiar face.

review/text: I'm married to the uber geek master of the universe. I think he would give Iron Man 10 stars. He's a comic book/graphic novel/sf guru. I hope he writes a review, but here is my take. I very much enjoyed Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. owns the part. It is amazing to watch his character evolve and see the light.  It was a bit violent for me, but the story is excellent with lots of plot twists. The pacing was very good. The special effects for the most part were fabulous and did not take over the plot. There is a lot of humor and just a little romance. This is sure to be the blockbuster start of an awesome summer movie season. Watch to the end of the credits for a peak at the next issue (I mean Iron Man II).

review/summary: A True Blockbuster
review/text: With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.  To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws.  You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges , I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost.  We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.  Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).  I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue:  Stark: "Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest..."  Jimmy: "We can talk, sir."  Stark: "Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright."  Ramirez: "You intimidate them, sir."  Stark: "Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."  Ramirez: "I'm an airman."  Stark: "Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?"  This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.  Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title "blockbuster." And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.

review/summary: The comic superhero movie I've been waiting for!
review/text: There will probably never be a "superhero" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.  But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real "fan-boy"), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.  This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a "weapon" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.   Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.  I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of "saucy" fun.  It's a clich&eacute;d role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.  Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).  So while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for "non-fans" too!!

review/summary: Wow and once again WOW.
review/text: As usual, I didn't know a thing about Iron Man before going to see it. I'm one of the many who probably hasn't read the comic books. And as a smart person said when we were sitting in a (very packed) cinema, 95% of the people in the cinema wouldn't have read the comic books either.  So what did I know about Iron Man? Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.  From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!  The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.  The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.  The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.  I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.  All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.

review/summary: Excellent adaption of the comic book hero!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Wow. Wow. Talk about a great film forget about the people who say this movie fails. Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general. It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story. Of course this is also attributed to the fact that comic book itself has all these qualities as well. For anyone who wants more of Iron Man after watching the movie, I would highly suggest getting in the comic you won't be disappointed!!!  (Spoilers) The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.  The film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).  Backstory: Iron Man or should I say Tony Stark (who in my opinion is one of the most underrated comic book heroes who doesn't quite the same publicity as Bob Kane's Batman) is a wealthy socialite who makes his life building and selling weapons. In a way just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark is a business superhero. Also, unlike Spider-Man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.  Tony Stark, Iron Man fights against a corporation/terrorist group known as Ten Rings in Afghanistan. In the comic book, Iron Man has many adventures fighting groups that have profited and used his own weapon systems from Stark Industries.  Stark is forced to create a replica of one of his Jericho missiles for the group or face death. Worse yet, Stark having felt a blast that has left shrapnel near his heart MUST wear a chest plate to protect his heart. Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and  helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him. Yinsen helps Tony get the necessary time to get Iron Man up and running. This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.  After this recovery from death and from the words of Yinsen who tells him not to waste his life, Stark has a major epiphany. He no longer wants to make weapons of destruction, he wants to save lives. His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man. I will not spoil what else happens except that it's excellent.  Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with Jon Favreau who said he was going to make a movie that would make lovers of the comic book happy but also make a movie simple enough that you didn't have to be an expert in it. What a smart guy he is. Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project. I mean Marvel wants to make a franchise of Iron Man just like they did with Spider-Man so a lot was riding on the line and Favreau delivered a home run!!!  Speaking of home runs, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was unbelievable I cannot think now in retrospect a better pick for the role. Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good.  I'am glad they went with this cast and didn't go for the younger cast which would not have achieved the same results of this very adult oriented comic book hero's life.  Again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we  have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects. On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.  I don't know what else to say if what I say hasn't convinced you that Iron Man is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie in general then there's nothing I can do. However, you will be missing out on one heck of a great movie. Thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Stupendous Movie!
review/text: This movie was everything that I had hoped for. Once again a Marvel comic book hero has made a good movie. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job of portraying Iron Man(Tony Stark). Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries who manufactures weapons. He is in Afghanistan when his helicopter is blown from the air and he is captured. He is held hostage by al-Quaida terrorists. He is ordered to construct a Jericho missile. On the sly he builds an Iron Man suit. It has weapons and flies at supersonic speeds. He stages a daring escape. He also suffers heart damage during his capture. He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition. He returns to America and fine tunes his invention. He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil. Jeff Bridges plays his business mentor and pardner who is trying to take his company away from him. They wind up in a pitched battle. The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous. This is a must see movie. The scene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie. A fantastic movie.

review/summary: The Best Superhero Movie So Far...
review/text: I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.  The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.  The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.  The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.  Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.  Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.  Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.  Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. As for it's Blu-Ray value, it's a must-own. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!

review/summary: A Not-So-Perfect But INVINCIBLE Hero
review/text: This was definitely a good movie. I'm a thirteen-year-old girl, and I think that -- if and ONLY if you skip through a certain part about ten minutes into the movie -- it is suitable for all ages, though some little kids would likely get scared. Why did I want to watch Iron Man? Basically I absolutely love Marvel, and my friend absolutely loves Robert Downey Jr's character of Iron Man. So when I settled down to watch the first movie, I was expecting only the best.  Near the beginning of the movie, as I said, there was a not-so-appropriate scene with Tony Stark aka Iron Man and a news reporter girl. I was watching it with my parents and my seven-year-old brother, and my parents turned it off. I wasn't allowed to see the rest for a while -- not until it was recommended by some very reliable people. When I was allowed to finish watching Iron Man, me and my dad saw the rest together. It was a great movie, with an epic playboy Tony, a nice likeable Pepper, a ruthless evil Obediah, and an awesome trusty Rhodey, not to mention the handy robot J.A.R.V.I.S.  I won't spoil the plot, but that plot was awesome! As with all of Marvel's movies, it was the kind of thing that glues you in place till it's over. Tony was not the classic hero. In fact, he was a bit too egotistical. But although he was nothing like your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman, he still had that great superhero appeal. And he wanted to help people, which is always a good sign.  Yes, Tony Stark was played by Robert Downey Jr. If you know a bit about that particular actor... well, you know he is a bit like Iron Man, only not a hero. But let's not think too much about the actors' personal lives -- Robert did an awesome job at portraying Tony. It was really incredible, what made the movie so great. Yes, it was the director; yes, it was the scriptwriter; yes, it was the epic Marvelness; yes, it was the designers; yes, it was totally the other actors; but most of all, it was the performance of Downey. Congratulations, Robert!  All in all, Iron Man was a fantastic movie. I would be more than willing to rewatch it several times over; but, then again, there are quite a few movies I like to rewatch. But Iron Man is definitely worth watching at least once.

review/text: We've all seen the movie by now and know how good it is, so I don't need to review the movie itself.  The video quality is great like it should be for a Blu-Ray, however, the sound was a little disappointing!  The sound is only Dolby D, not DTS like most Blu-rays, so you don't get the "full" sound like usual.  That's the only bad thing I can say about quality or video itself.

review/summary: This lead in the pants is actually enjoyable
review/text: I try not to get too wrapped up into movies based on comic books (er, graphic novels, excuse moi); I tend to find them too trite and superfluous.  But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.  Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here; his portrayal of billionaire weapons designer Tony Stark is humorous, compelling, and--yes, even in an over the top super hero flick--believable.  Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic--in other words, all too human.  While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.  Is the story silly and farfetched?  Yes.  Is it occasionally sophomoric and extreme?  Yes.  Does it require a titanic suspension of disbelief?  Of course, but who cares?  Following a nasty stint as a hostage to some snarling jihadists (and escaping via an iron suit of his own making), Stark disavows the weapons of mass carnage his company has made, and focuses entirely on the technology to replicate the iron suit utilizing state-of-the-art technology.  This places him at odds with longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), who, incidentally, is working on a suit of his own.  And of course this leads at breakneck speed to the ultimate battle of the Iron Men, who create carnage and mayhem in overload volume in downtown LA--all while Stark's personal assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning) looks on in terror and dismay.  The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious; IRON MAN may be based on comic books, but this is one super hero film worth relishing again and again. --D. Mikels, Esq.

review/summary: Iron Man 2 Disc Blu ray Special Edition
review/text: Anchored by a top rate performance by Robert Downey Jr., this  exciting, well directed take on Iron Man will go down as one of the best comic book movies out this generation.  The respect and love of the filmmakers for the material is evident throughout the film.  Marvel studios could not have chosen a better film to be their first independently financed and produced movie.  The movie set the bar high for all the Marvel films that came after (and it is debatable whether or not any film, including the sequel to Iron Man, ever reached that bar again).  The 2 Disc Blu-Ray Ultimate Edition is fantastic. On the first disc you get a 47 minute documentary that explores the Iron Man comic book, from its origins to the current story lines he is involved in (at least at the time of the film's original release).  The writers and artists who have worked on Iron Man over the years take part in the documentary, discussing what changes they made to the character and why.  As someone who didn't really follow the Iron Man comic book, I found the documentary to be fascinating.  Also on the first disc is a collection of deleted/extended scenes, running for a total of 24 minutes.  Most of these are superfluous additions, bits of dialogue or action scenes that don't add anything to the story and were almost certainly taken out for pacing reasons.  There is a feature that focuses on the 4 different suits in the movie.  You can view each suit from any angle, checking out the function/feature of each piece.  I like the concept, but it takes to long to load each section.  What we're missing on this disc is something I really wanted...a director's commentary and/or a cast commentary.  The 2nd disc is devoted to the making of the movie itself.  The highlight is a 7 part documentary that runs almost 2 hours.  It covers all aspects of the production, from initial designs, through shooting, and into the editing and special effects.  It was filmed concurrently with the production, so you get a mixture of "on the set" interviews and interviews done later looking back at the production.  As a whole, it is a well done documentary.  It isn't a classic like Heart of Darkness (which covers the filming of Apocalypse Now) or The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (which covers 12 Monkeys), but it isn't a pure fluff piece.  I highly recommend watching this.  The 2nd disc also contains a 27 minute featurette on the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s screen test,  In the end, the movie is the star here, but this is a very well done special edition.  If/when they re-release the blu-ray (probably around the release of Iron Man 3), I don't know what else they could add to make it a better edition, except for a commentary track or two.

review/summary: Really...Really Good Movie!
review/text: Okay, so I'm following the whole super hero thing primarily because they are great action films that allow me to use the full functionality of my 3D TV along with my 7.1 surround sound system.  I almost never go to a movie any more.  After taking my grandson to the movies to see super 8, I may never go to a movie again unless it's an IMAX movie.  Super 8 was way better on blu ray in my living room.  I kid you not. By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.I just wait for the Blu Ray release, make some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It's way cheaper.  That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.  The storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.  About the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.  I found myself using close-caption since some parts of the movie was inaudible.  This tragedy...yes I said tragedy is found in alot of movies now-a-days.  What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.  What's all of the mumbling about?  I'm sure that I'm not the only one screaming about this.  Why mumble when you can speak. Clearly. Decisively. With intent. So that you can be heard. Through one or eight speakers.  Nonetheless, this cannot be blamed on the actors. Weight must fall on the directors and producers.  If the mike can pick up the slightest sound, then have the actor stand back a little to match the mike. How hard is this?  Fortunately, movies made since the time of the release of this one seem to be made better and with more attention paid regarding spoken voice audibility.  If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline. Not withstanding the crappy audio, I still highly recomment this movie because it is a great storyline with stellar action.

review/summary: The Best of the Avengers Series
review/text: I personally am not a superhero comic book reader, nor am I really a fan of the genre.  This movie changed my perspective on all of that.  I had been skeptical of even watching this particular film.  Before this movie I honestly didn't find Robert Downey Jr. to be a compelling actor.  Boy was I wrong.  Downey is spectacular as Tony Stark and has proved to me to be a very capable iconic character actor. (His portrayal of Holmes was great too but that's another review).  He's funny, snarky, flawed, and not the traditional hero that we are all so used to, which made me root for him even more.  He makes us love Tony despite the fact that the character's demeanor is meant to not be liked.  The graphics are great, the story is strong, and kudos for Gwen Paltrow. Her role as Pepper Potts is also nontraditional.  She's not the damsel in distress we're all use to, and is the perfect opposite for Downey's role. This is a refreshing new take of a superhero story and has thrown me head first into the whole Marvel universe as a new fan. Strong Cast and just a fun movie to watch.  Highly suggested for everyone, even the non superhero types out there.

review/summary: Robert Downey, Jr. is fantastic
review/text: Okay, so I must confess I am not a comic book afficionado so I was blissfully unaware of the Iron Man comic series, but I don't think you need to know the comic strip to enjoy this movie immensely, because I did.  I love the quirkiness that Robert Downey, Jr. brought to the character and that he's more than just a spoiled genius with unlimited financial resources, he's got a conscience and he's determined to do right in the world.  The special effects are great but they don't overpower the storyline, which is a wonderful change of pace because the story can hold its own, even without all of the special Iron Man CGI stuff.  The interplay between the two main characters, Trask and Rhodes, is believable and you see how much both men care for and respect each other.  The character of Pepper is tedious and a bit whiney, but that might simply be what Ms. Paltrow bring to the part.  This movie was a refreshing and very pleasant surprise, which makes me want to see how the sequel is handled...  In fact, I think I'll put it in the DVD player right now and see how well they did!  It was a surprise to find a really great, entertaining movie and not feel like I had to endure the heaps and gobs of special effects to get back to the actual story.  I cannot recommend this movie enough for the sheer enjoyment of being entertained without being patronized or bombarded with loud explosions and foul language.  This is a true gem of a movie.

It just makes me happy.  Of course the beginning is dark, but Tony Stark becomes such a true hero.  From utter prick to hero!  LOL!  I'm not too sure how I feel about the 2nd one they have in the works.  It doesn't look as good to me, but I guess I'll find out soon enough. Anyway!

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: Iron Man is a character that I never in my history of comic book fandom cared about. When talk first started circulating about an Iron Man movie, my thought was "I guess they're hitting them all eventually," considering that we've already been subjected to Ghost Rider and Daredevil/Elektra. Especially now that Marvel has founded their very own studio so that they can produce movies themselves instead of selling the rights and points on the back end to others, it seems fairly certain that their catalog of heroes isn't going to be closing itself off to the multiplex any time soon.    But after seeing Iron Man, I'm sort of ok with that. Provided of course, that the movies they make are more like Iron Man and less like the Fantastic Four franchise. It isn't that Iron Man is any amazing special film, but it isn't terrible. In the spectrum of superhero movies, it falls somewhere maybe slightly behind the first X-Men, but well in front of the awful third one. It isn't Spiderman II, Hellboy, or Batman Begins. But it certainly isn't Daredevil.    There is one thing and one thing alone that makes Iron Man such an enjoyable movie. Robert Downey Jr. The script is ok, and Jon Favreau does a pretty decent ass job in the director's chair for it too, but it is Downey that carries the weight of the movie on his metal clad shoulders. He plays Tony Stark with such a flair for delightful bastardness, yet does not fall short at the moments when he must also show real emotion, real conflict as his character realizes his place in the world.    Downey brings to the table the most enjoyable performance in a popcorn movie since Johnny Depp set sail as Captain Jack Sparrow in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Despite Stark's personal conflicts, he is the least angst-ridden super hero in recent memory, delighting in every moment he spends refining and eventually kicking evil ass in his suit. It is an interesting twist on the paradigm of the costumed hero that Stark is more weighed down by the impact on the world he has created as a normal person, albeit a larger than life normal person, than he does as a costumed crusader. His joy in being a superhero reminds us of something often forgotten in many of the overly dark failures in comic book adaptations the last few years, the reason so many little kids want to be superheroes in the first place: it looks kind of fun.

review/text: I enjoy this film every time I watch it. There was a lot of hype going into Iron Man, and the film satisfied nearly everyone. The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more. The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film. I hope the sequal is just as good.

review/summary: Best Super Hero movie EVER! (so far)
review/text: I have watched this movie at leasst once a week since it was released on DVD,I saw it on screen. SOmeone was paying attention when they made this one. I was a kid in the  60s an read a lot of Marvel comics on a regular basis. (Missed the X-men,but they are boring and lame) This film come as close to perfect as the medium can possibly get  for capturing the spirit of the REAL Marvel comic.As well as beating out EVERY other superhero move EVER made. OK the first spiderman came close, but SFX werent quite there (The series deterioated rapidly)  The nearest experience was when the first Superman came out (yes a totaly silly movie now, ) People criticize it for  the  "building the armour scenes" those scenes gave the film its total feeling of being very real and believable. Robt. Downey was great.(He will be as  remembered for the role as Clayton Moore is for the Lone Ranger!!) The story took priority over  flash and SFX. I know that is dangerous in these days when brain dead ADHD teens are the main target for most film makers these days. If you have truly lived (born before 1960!) this is the best . (The Dark who!?)  Iron man will be remembered when  the loser who plays batman (Christian  "EFFING" who?")  is  doing appearences at grocery stores!

review/summary: Some Heroes Are Built...
review/text: Several years ago when rumors really began heating up about the possibility of an actual Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, I thought that there would be no way it would really work. Sure, comic book movies were on the rise, and director Sam Raimi had shown to us that a man really can web-sling and wall-crawl, and Bryan Singer proved that super-powered mutants do exist; however, a man in a metal suit flying around still seemed like an awfully daunting task to make us believe. Now, these weren't the first rumors of an Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, they were just the most credible. No, rumors of this project have existed since around 1990, when it was being bounced from studio to studio. Even some Hollywood A-listers, such as Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, were being tossed around as possible stars for the vehicle, and director Quentin Tarentino was one of the primary contenders for the directing job (who knows what the movie would have ended up like if any of this had actually come true). However, none of that ever came close to fruition, and the project lay dormant for almost 20 years. That was until director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey, Jr. made the movie into an incredible reality that took the 2008 summer box office by storm.  Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a rich, powerful, and undeniably brilliant weapons manufacturer, womanizer, and self-centered man who lives the life so many dream of. But that all changes when he finds himself captured by a terrorist organization who want to use him to create weapons solely for their own evil purposes. With his options limited, Stark does the one thing no one ever expected him to do, he becomes a hero. Clad in a metallic suit of his own design, Tony finally knows what his purpose is in life, and as the hero known as "Iron Man" he now has the means by which to protect the people he once put in harm's way.  Truth be told, the long wait between those first rumors in the 90's to now, was probably just what the movie needed to become a true success, for several reasons. For starters, the technology necessary to create the obligatory visual effects sequences (of which there are many) involving the metal-clad hero have finally become available, as proven by the smash hit "Transformers". Prior to that film I don't believe some of the visuals achieved in this movie would have been nearly as convincing to audiences. Second, the perfect casting choice was made in the form of Robert Downey, Jr., a talented actor who has had his fair share of troubles (many of which are surprisingly similar to Tony Stark's in the comic books), and one whose star power wasn't great enough that his private life would outshine anything done on the screen. Lastly, Marvel was finally able to create their own movie studio, allowing them full creative control and ensuring that the character and story were as true to the source material as possible. It's for all these reasons listed here, and even some that aren't, that "Iron Man" became such a successful adaptation, and had the film come to fruition sooner, who knows what the outcome would have been.  The story for "Iron Man" is two-fold: on one hand the story is a tale of redemption for a man who has lived a life of self-indulgence and freedom from any sort of consequences to his actions; while on the other, it is a fairly faithful to the source material origin story of a new kind of superhero that was born out of one man's sheer will-power to live. As a moviegoer and comic book aficionado I love when an adaptation of one of my heroes comes to life on the big screen as both a faithful representation (or as close as one can get to decades of comic history in only a couple of hours), as well as a really strong film that isn't just a bunch of summer popcorn movie fluff.  The screenplay written by the writing teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby ("Children of Men") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway ("Punisher: War Zone") was surprisingly cohesive given the number of hands stirring the pot, so to speak. Generally, when the number of writers goes beyond two, the chances for the film actually working out all that well dwindle significantly; however, "Iron Man" proved to be one of those rare exceptions to the rule. Filled with plenty of humor, action, drama, and a dash of romance, the story for "Iron Man" is easily one of the best origin adaptations for a superhero that I have ever seen in a movie.  As great as the story was, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of the minor problems that crept into the film. These problems aren't in any way overtly distracting from the end result, but they should be addressed all the same. First, from a purely comic geek standpoint the film's location was completely wrong, Stark is based out of New York City (as are most of Marvel's heroes), yet the film takes place predominantly in California. Personally, this alteration to the origin didn't actually bother me, but I know it did some purists, and I can understand why. Second, the attempted twist involving the film's villain was poorly executed, and was easily seen from the very beginning; however, I don't believe the intent was to actually make the primary villain's reveal all that much of a shocker. But there was obviously some attempt made to surprise the audience, and if it actually succeeded it would only be for those not paying close attention. This problem wasn't like the first, where I didn't really care either way, because it did kind of frustrate me that more effort wasn't put into this twist to make it somewhat surprising. Like I said, in the end these problems weren't anything major, but they still existed nonetheless.  For this film, fledgling Marvel Studios wisely chose to sort of buck the Hollywood system by going with some truly surprising, yet inspired choices for both cast and crew. Choosing Jon Favreau ("Elf") as the director was a shock to many, and even caused some to wonder just how good this film could actually be. Sure, Favreau proved he could handle family comedy with "Elf", and some of his early work is fairly dramatic, and as far as visual effects goes, he did a decent enough job on "Zathura"; yet, would he have what it takes to tackle something as big as a comic book icon's first major film adaptation? Apparently, the answer was yes, and any questioning of the decision was quickly silenced when Favreau debuted some footage during Comic-Con, much to the vast delight of many a comic geek. The other shocking choice, and arguably the most disputed was that of casting troubled actor Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Even though he hardly seemed the proper fit for the character, Robert perfectly captured the very nature of Tony Stark right down to his physical appearance, quick-wit, and attitude, for all intents and purposes Downey, Jr. was Tony Stark through and through.  Comprising the supporting cast of characters, were a group of talented actors and actresses whose hiring weren't nearly as scrutinized. Gwyneth Paltrow ("Shakespeare in Love"), although not my first choice for the role, turned out to be the perfect Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant. It was a decidedly different role for Gwyneth who typically does more dramatic work, and even more surprising, while at the same time a very smart move on her part, was that this was the role she chose as her first project post-pregnancy hiatus. Joining her was Jeff Bridges ("Arlington Road") as Obadiah Stane, Tony's mentor and right-hand man in operating the day-to-day activities of Stark Industries. For fans of Jeff's work, many will be surprised by how different he looks as this character, with his shaved head and full beard, Jeff is almost unrecognizable from his appearances in virtually every other movie he's ever made. Rounding out the main supporting cast members is Terrence Howard ("Four Brothers") as James "Rhodey" Rhodes, an Air Force pilot, and close friend to Tony Stark. Terrence was again another terrific choice, and he really played well off of anything Robert Downey, Jr. would throw at him. Their typically light-hearted conversations full of playfully intended put-downs and sarcasm really helped to solidify their close, almost brotherly bond the two men share with one another. All in all, the casting for this film, whether heavily questioned or just unquestionably accepted, couldn't have been any better as each of the cast members delivered top-notch performances.  "Iron Man" was one of 2008's biggest blockbusters, second only to "The Dark Knight", and the film rightfully earns its place amongst the best comic book adaptations ever made. Boasting a strong story, visually stunning special effects, brilliant casting decisions, and just some good old fashioned fun, "Iron Man" is not just a comic book blockbuster, but a great movie that audiences will enjoy over and over again. By the way, be sure to watch after the credits for a bonus scene that offers a hint of things to come.  "Iron Man" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and brief sensuality.

review/summary: Armored Avenger Hits the Big Screen!
review/text: My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.  I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an "Iron Man" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?  There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.  The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various "distractions" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s "coming back" role.  It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.  Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.  Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.  Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James "Rhodey" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, "Next time!"  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes "War Machine.")  The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.  The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.  If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.  Also, "Iron Man" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.  I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in "Iron Man 2."  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot.

review/summary: Iron Man (Blu-ray)
review/text: Movie - 4.5  I first saw the movie in theaters with zero expectations. I never followed the comics, let alone pay any attention to the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was starring in the lead role. Thank goodness that happened, because I was blown away by the end. The whole guilt and redemption angle on the character of Tony Stark struck a very deep resonance with me, as I'm a big fan of "comeback" stories where the protagonist falls so far off his high horse, only to realize his mistakes, then use those events as a learning tool and lead himself to do greater good. Nowadays, it's hard to see the good in most people because of how lost we are in the desires and routine ineptitudes of society. More often than not, our lives revolve around either money, sex, or some other kind of self-indulgence. Granted, it's not a bad thing to wanna' be happy, but I thought this particular story put a certain kind of perspective on the corporate and war profiteering elements that exist in today's world. And what better an example of how to explore the truth and consequences of this by having a billionaire weapons manufacturer have a a change in character and try to make a difference from the heart instead of the wallet? I really enjoyed the movie's plot and characters from beginning to end. Downey Jr. plays Stark down to a T, and the supporting cast is fun to watch from Pepper to Rhodie (too bad Howard won't be back, though), even to Jarvis. If anything, my only problem is the lack in depth of a true supervillain. While Jeff Bridges does a great job as Obidiah Stane, the movie iss missing that extra sense of ambition that really separates the ideals of most bad guys. As a setup movie, however (for the supposed trilogy), I rank this in the upper echelon along Batman Begins as one of my favorites. And if history has dictated anything, it's that the 2nd act of a trilogy has always greatly outdone its predecessor. Can't wait till the next one comes out.  Video - 5.0  Colors are very vibrant from skin tones to backgrounds to all the shiny versions of the Iron Man suits. Paramount has done a spectacular job on the transfer, making this instant demo material for friends, family, or business alike. In particular, the cave break and liberation of Gulmira (including the jet chase) scenes are worth watching over and over again just for the flashy lights and sleek cinematography. Black levels handle extremely well during cave, night, and other dimly-lit scenes keeping most, if not all, kinds of object detail looking crisp and sharp. Contrast is equally suiting and really helps the overall photography adding a complimentary sense of depth and dimensionality between people, objects, and backgrounds. The only slight problem one might have is with the darker cave scene. They used a different camera for those shots resulting in a slightly noisier presentation, which is what happens on a normal basis with darker shots anyway, but that's about the only possible imperfection and may not even effect your own personal score if you're not being picky. But other than that, show off your Blu-ray setup with this movie.  Audio - 5.0  Accompanying the flawless video transfer is an equally flawless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Ramin Djwadi's score, while a tad underwhelming composition-wise, is displaced well-enough to help create just the right amount of immersion for each scene, and dialogue is clear through the center channel. Directionality and separation are especially notable during scenes of gunfire or jet-propelled flight. Again, refer to the cave break and liberation of Gulmira with the jet chase to hear what I'm talking about. Maybe even thrown in the Mk. II's test flight for good measure. LFEs are astounding in terms of bass depth and other low frequency presence. I personally like to use Stark's takeoff to Gulmira and jump into supersonic speed during his run from the F-22s as go-to showcase material. So make sure your theater system has all the right settings, then crank that baby up to wow your guests.  Extras - 5.0  Thanks in big part to the hours of extras on both the feature and additional 25GB disc, I actually learned quite a bit of informative things about the Iron Man franchise as a whole and the respectable hard work that went into producing this summer blockbuster. Ironically enough, I now see Iron Man as a sort of Marvel parallel to DC's Batman, only with less of the dark psychology and grimness involved with Bruce Wayne's tragic childhood. On top of being presented completely in HD, the special features are loads of fun to watch in themselves, and I don't think I've ever been as thoroughly entertained by just the making of portion. If you like the movie, you'll really like these extras.  Overall - 5.0  For a setup of an eventual trilogy, I rank this as the top tier with Batman Begins as the other best of its kind. The characters and script are highly entertaining, and the story has just the right amount of depth to bring about my empathy. Throw in the demo quality video and audio and a largely informative array of special features, and you've got yourself one of the years best Blu-ray packages. A must own for comic book fans.

review/text: This film has a little of everything for everyone.  Great writing, great actors and wonderful CGI.  I was never a comic book fan, but in the past decade Marvel has lured me into seeing what the big fascination has been all about.  When one franchise begins to falter (Spider Man) a new one comes onto the scene and takes everyone's breath away.  I only had a few gripes-one Downey's 1940's fast talking/ scarastic delivery some times comes off muffled and who's big idea was it to have such small font on the scenes where translation was needed?  It reminded me of the small print in shady contracts.  Do they really expect people to be able to read it? Other than that-it is great entertainment and I'm looking forward to the next installment to the series.

review/summary: The 2-Disc Ultimate Edition Delivers!
review/text: The first disc features 11 deleted and extended scenes. There's more of the opening ambush with Tony Stark being more proactive. We also see more footage of Rhodes and it quickly becomes apparent that he was the character with the most scenes cut from the film. We also see Tony and Pepper Potts attend another party.  The second disc starts off with the impressive "I Am Iron Man," a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production. For example, we are taken step-by-step through the construction of the Iron Man armor with Robert Downey Jr. cracking jokes while being fitted for it. It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person. This is due in large part to the genius of the late-great Stan Winston and his company. Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.  "The Invincible Iron Man" is a six-part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character. Stan Lee says that he modeled Stark after Howard Hughes, for the most part. He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor - hence its many changes over the years. This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos. This is a very well done overview of the comic book.  "Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man" examines the CGI work that went into realizing Iron Man's powers, like flying, his repulsors, and so on. Director Jon Favreau says that he likes to use practical effects whenever possible, which is wonderfully refreshing to hear, and in this film he mixed the practical with CGI.  "Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test." Incredibly, the actor had to do a screen test because the studio deemed him a risky proposition and this footage shows that he had a handle on the character very early on.  "The Actor's Process" features fascinating footage of Jeff Bridges and Downey rehearsing a scene with Favreau. It's great to see these guys at work and offers insight into how they put together a scene from the film from an acting point-of-view.  "The Onion's Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full-Length Film" is a funny satire where a newscaster "breaks" a story of how the Iron Man trailer will be made into a film that pokes fun at the rabid nature of the hardcore fanbase of the character.  Finally, there are "Galleries," featuring concept art, technology stills, behind-the-scenes photographs, and poster art.

review/summary: Iron man fires on all thrusters; and does NOT disappoint
review/text: There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick...let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.  Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out back story. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.  The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, "no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can." I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.  As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liaison, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show "Dinner for Five" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.  One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.  Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the back story and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.

review/summary: The best comic book superhero movie since "Spider-Man 2"
review/text: Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6M">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>."  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of "Iron Man" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).  Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that "Iron Man" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2</a>."  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but "Iron Man" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles:.  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000294TC4">Ned Kelly</a>).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.  Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in "Tales of Suspense" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men</a>") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.  As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8952K">Ally McBeal</a>," may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785118608">comic book</a>, especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.  Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia "Pepper" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382">The Ultimates</a>" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman.

review/summary: Issue with TrueHD has been FIXED prior to release. Buy with confidence!
review/text: Reviewers who received advanced copies of the Iron Man Blu-ray release reported that the Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) flag was active on the Dobly TrueHD audio track, causing a less-than-stellar audio experience for customers who weren't savvy enough to adjust their player and amplifier to compensate.  The good news is that Paramount confirmed on September 25th that they had recalled all of the defective copies and replaced them with newly-authored discs that fix this issue. [...]  This recall occurred prior to Iron Man's release, so no one should have wound up with a defective copy except for the reviewers who received their copies in advance. You can purchase with confidence without worrying whether your product is the corrected one, unlike with the Back to the Future DVDs and Pirates of the Carribbean I Blu-ray which still have defective copies unknowingly being sold by some stores despite having been re-authored after the initial batch.

review/summary: Movie: Awesome, Blu-ray:Crippled
review/text: Okay, first off if you own a Web Enabled Blu-ray player like a PS3, you're going to have to wait a long time before you can watch this Blu-ray after you pop it in. Why? Some pinhead executive at the movie studio/blu-ray production house thought it would be cute to require you to download some stupid software you're probably not going to use for "extra features"  BEFORE you can even get to the main menu. I had to wait so long to watch it I thought the disc was defective. I had enough time to call Amazon and arrange a replacement. (Then I installed installed Windows XP to my MacBook and I was still waiting. If you've ever installed XP you know how long that takes too.) This means that each time I pop this Blu-ray into a new player, like if I take it to a friend's house,  I'm going to have to tell my friend(s): okay let's just wait an hour then we can watch the movie. This is completely and totally absurd. I hope whoever decided this was a good idea gets fired.  After about an hour and a half, I was able to watch this movie though. It's a really great movie. It's right up there with WALL*E and The Dark Knight. It has a very fun comic book feel to it, while not being absurdly stupid. If you can suspend your disbelief for 120 some odd minutes, it's a great ride.  Robert Downey Jr. is a great Tony Stark. When I first heard he was cast as Iron Man, I thought "yeah right! This movie's gonna suck." But I was very wrong. He pulls off the ladies man/billionaire playboy/hot shot role very well. But this is only half of the movie: The other half: Iron Man action scenes are just flat out cool. The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great. This is a first rate production.  Also, I didn't know who his assistant was before the credits rolled  but she looked familiar (Turns out it was Gwyneth Paltrow) and she made a really interesting character too, for a supporting role. You even have Jeff ("The Dude") Bridges in there doing a great job playing Stark's second in command.  Oh, and when the credits roll, don't turn off the movie. There's a little scene after all the credits that fans of the comics and fans of this movie shouldn't miss.  Summary: The Blu-Ray gets a 1 star for the incompetence of whomever decided it was a good idea to make people download something before they could even see the main menu.  The Movie Gets 5 Stars for great execution - cast/acting, storyline, effects, and action scenes. Dare I say: This is the best Marvel Comics movie to date.

review/summary: To fix the "Blue Ring of Death" on the PS3
review/text: The movie itself is fantastic, but the disc could use some work...  If you own a PS3 the geniuses at Paramount decided to make you download the BDLive content before you can watch the movie, causing the "Blue Ring of Death."  So basically, it's not an error, it is a feature lol!  If you wait long enough, it will clear and you will be able to play the movie.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if their severs can handle the numbers right now (1800 hrs on the east coast with the #1 new movie = a loooong download time).  The other option is to turn off your internet connection during B-ray movies on you PS3 (check under BR options).  This will allow you to skip the download and get right to the movie (just download it later at a better time).

review/summary: Great Movie, great sound, great video and great extras (and a fix for the long load or what seems a no load)
review/text: Having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that I really liked the movie. My second impression is that it would look nice in HD. Thankfully Marvel Studios and Paramount have delivered a great Blu Ray release w/ HD video.  So the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. You won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.  Tony Stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of Stark Enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. While traveling through Iraq to show off his great new weapons the Humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. He awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion Tony was caught in from reaching his heart.  In captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a Jericho missile. Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes. The experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.  Action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is Iron Man in a nut shell.  The video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing. The only areas of "problem" would be in the cave scenes. You can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. The areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype Iron Man suit (done in CG) and his environment and the terrorists. It's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the CG interaction less perceptible. It doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.  The audio is done in Dolby True-HD and sounds fantastic. Lows are low and highs are high. No clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.  Having bought quite a few Blu Ray discs, I'm painfully aware of the lack of HD extras. Not so with Iron Man. This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. And yes, the documentaries are ALL in HD. This may be the first Blu Ray disc I've purchased with all HD extras.  Also included is a BD Live connection. I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. Not sure about the BD Live extras.  So if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than Iron Man on Blu Ray.  FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING LONG LOAD TIMES:  If you have a BD Live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off "auto download" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). The reason the movie takes "forever" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from BD-Live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.  And once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie.

review/summary: 4.5--The truth is.......................Downey flies high!
review/text: Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself. It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now as Iron Man..  Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life. "Iron Man" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.  In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means. Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon Favreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the flavorless "DareDevil" from 2003.  So "Iron Man" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great; for those who enjoy a good message movie, it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true; and as a summer film, it's large and captivating, never letting the viewer go till the credits (and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes "Summer" films.

review/text: Please Note: Opinions are like...well you know how the saying goes. If you have one, write a review the voting system is for those who HAVEN'T purchased the item and whether or not the review was helpful in that decision.  "Titanium Alloy Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it as "Iron Man". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is "The Merchant of Death" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark almost literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.  He uses the crude tools to build a suit of iron that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by becoming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).  The Blu-ray looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. Heck, even the DVD is one of the top notch ones I've seen in recent years. As for the issue with TrueHD sound--Paramount has fixed that issue remanufacturing the BD and still meeting their release date.  The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary "I AM Iron Man" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette "Invincible Iron Man" that gives us an idea about the development of the characterwith interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, "Wired" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film. "hall of Armor" takes us into the development of the "suits".  Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of "The Dark Knight" (ironic considering that "Iron Man" is really Marvel's version of "Batman" except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the "Spider-Man" films directed by Sam Raimi.  The nice thing about "Iron Man" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).  Marvel's first in-house production "Iron Man" demonstrates that the comic book company turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or BD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third "Iron Man" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of "The Incredible Hulk".  Highly recommended!  Updated 9/30/08 FYI, if  you are having problems playing your disc select "No" if a menu comes up asking if you want to turn on BD Live or change the options in your settings for your PS3. I didn't have this problem however since I elected NOT to watch it on my PS3 but on my stand alone Blu-ray player.

review/summary: Iron-Man gets it right. Looking forward to more.
review/text: Iron-Man doesn't mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology in ways that he didn't foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have turned bad.  In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good.  Overall Iron-Man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality superhero movies then you can't go wrong with this.

review/summary: He is Iron Man
review/text: I could already tell this movie would be a lot of fun from the trailer, but I was surprised just how good it really was.  This could easily be one of my favourite Marvel Comics movies, better even than Spiderman or X-Men (forget Daredevil or Electra or Punisher or Ghost Rider).  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Marvel movies are usually well casted anyway, with the exception of Toby Maguire as Spiderman (he's popular, but I'm of the opinion that James Franco would have been better as the image of Peter Parker from the comics) and Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.  I also loved the use of the song "Iron Man" by Black Sabbath in the closing credits of the film, spot on.

review/summary: Great acting cast and the story
review/text: I must say that when I was growing up I did not read comic books.  I am still unsure if the Ironman movie is based on some Ironman comic book or not, but if it is, it really does not matter.  This is why.  The cast in this film:  Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges (who you will barely recognise), Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are amazing.  In the first 20 minutes I almost thought "where can this film possibly go from here?", but then the plot was so well thought out that you will want to see what are all these amazing characters up to.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the Ironman, a gifted scientist who inherits his father's weapons making corporation only to learn that it is time to grow up and take a responsibility for the damage that weapons can do not just to the rest of the world but also to the americans themselves.  He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.  A kind of a bad boy only Downey Jr. can profile.  Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.  I actuallly really like this action movie where the main character does not have to be another muscle but can charm us with his sense of humor, genuine smartness and charisma.  Robert Downey Jr. is all of that.  Enjoy! Oh, and if there is another Ironman movie coming out, I will want to be the first one to see it.

review/summary: Downey's Superhero Triumph
review/text: Director Jon Favreau's "Iron Man" may lack the epic stature of "The Dark Knight," but it's more entertaining. Thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired brilliance, this Marvel adaptation captures the fun and wonderment missing in the "Spider-Man" franchise. Favreau maintains the ideal balance of humor and action without resorting to CGI overkill. Downey  receives excellent support from Gwyneth Paltrow and classic villainy from Jeff Bridges. "Iron Man" is the rare comic-book movie that transcends its source material.

review/summary: OK , Comic Bookesque
review/text: Somewhere between the genius of Batman & Spiderman essence and the extreme ComicBookesqueness of Starship Troopers.  Simplistic, similar messages for all, but separated works by the means and methods of the execution.  Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role - starts and ends as a 2-D fellow.  Not sure what Palthrow's issue and direction were but who cares,  Jeff Bridges came off solid and believable as the egomaniac come of age.  Storyline and plot are chop shopish at best and connected only by the action. Overall, entertaining 2hours worthy of three stars and a rental.  In rank with the hulk and fantastic four but not quite the 'man' enough to keep pace and face with the spider, bat, and super.

review/summary: Eccentric Machine Humor
review/text: "Iron Man" entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.  While his song "Your Move" from the 4-year old CD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064AFK0">The Futurist</a> is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of "Iron Man" for my rainy day video shelf.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for "Chaplin" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's "Ally McBeal."  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOH">Shakespeare in Love</a>.  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> and his Oscar-nominated role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning "Crash" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in "Four Christmases" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!

review/summary: An excellent movie with tons of great humor, a few cool action scenes, and a great story
review/text: Iron Man is a really great movie. Robert Downey Jr. really steals the show with his superb acting job as Tony Stark/Iron Man by being absolutely hilarious all throughout and portraying his character perfectly. The film's soundtrack is also notable, full of electric guitar sound mixed with orchestrated stuff and it sounds great and fits the movie really well. The few action scenes in the movie are really cool, and although the final battle is a little underwhelming, the rest is really fun to watch. There are a lot of great, memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie too, my favorite part is probably when he blows up the tank, man that makes me laugh so hard. Add spectacular visual effects and a promised sequel and you get a movie no superhero film fan should miss, and people outside that category have good reason to enjoy it too.

review/text: This review is not lengthy description of the plot of Iron Man, it is simply written to tell you that this is by far the best Super Hero movie made in a very long time.  I originally thought it was going to be another corny over the top Super Hero theme flick that is entertaining because of the action but leaves you empty.  This movie has decent acting, by far the best Robert Downy Jr. movie I have ever seen and he made me want to watch more. Gwenyth Paltrow plays a simple yet crucial role and provides an excellent counter part to Downy Jr.  This really is a must see and you will not be disappointed by the pick.  As long as you are looking for a high action entertaining choice, Iron Man is the way to go!

While I don't collect Iron Man comic books, I do know of the story. While parts had to be changed for the movie, it was not at all disappointing.  I enjoyed the movie greatly and its characters and story development (and the acting by Robert Downey Jr. was awesome!). Even a die-hard Iron Man fan should not be disappointed in this movie.  My favorite part of the movie was when he flew to the Middle East in his new suit, and dealt with the terrorists while saving the civilians, and then leaving the leader of the terrorists to the villagers to do with what they wanted. Sweet justice, indeed!

review/summary: FINALLY, MARVEL DELIVERS A TERRIFIC SUPERHERO FILM! (Some Spoilers)
review/text: After sitting through some rather lackluster Marvel adaptations, such as the overrated "Spider-man" and "X-Men" films, I sat to watch "Iron Man" with cautious optimism. And it proved to be worthwhile. This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date. Dispensing with over-serious storylines, such as in "Spider-man 2" and "The Hulk," the story never takes itself too seriously, bringing the fun and excitement back to the superhero movie. The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver. And the performances? What can I say? Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero. His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart. The supporting cast, including Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, plus a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, add to the film's richness. After what seemed like an eternity, a Marvel superhero film truly delivers! If you enjoy superhero films, then "Iron Man" will blow you away! Movie/DVD Grade: A+

review/summary: Great movie, somewhat less so on the political message
review/text: Robert Downey Jr. makes the movie for sure - he plays his character to a "T".  There is a reasonable amount of Iron Man action, but much of the movie seems to be setting up the sequel.  I agree with one reviewer's comments regarding the not-so-subtle political message in the film that powerful people in the business of making weapons delight in conflict and will create conflict if none exist to maximize their profits and power ("evil war mongering capitalists" versus patriots with a desire for freedom to triumph over tyranny).  Contrasted with Batman, The Dark Knight, in my opinion a better (albeit disturbing) movie - the notion of inherent evil is recognized as a force to be battled with unyielding courage, strength, and ingenuity.  Tony Stark is confronted with the fact that that up close - war is a dirty business and when advanced weapons fall into the hands of ruthless people with a lust to control others - harm will come to innocents.  In his subsequent conversion to a less capitalistic humanitarian - eschewing the advancement of weapons to wage war and the profits that follow - he manages in a twist of irony to invent a weapon more deadly then anything he's ever created.  Overall, it's a very good film - good cinematography, special effect, action, acting, and story.  On the down-side: as a family movie, I would have preferred that the gratuitous sex scene was implied vs. demonstrated (I realize it was relevant to develop Tony's character);  a fairly large portion of the action was Tony perfecting his suit vs. battling villains; and, I would have preferred a less trite portrayal of the defense industry and scientists.  Hopefully, the sequel will get down to the business of heroic action battling evil.

review/text: Now here is a "comic" book movie. They didn't mess too much with the costume, it didn't take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned.

Plus I find Samuel a tough actor to like now a days.  But that's just me.

review/summary: Best Marvel Movie
review/text: This has to be the best Marvel movie so far.  It is like reading a well written classic novel.  The movie is well structured from start to finish.  I like the way how Tony is casted into different characters in the movie.  What I want to say is that the Ego, Super-Ego, etc. which are part of Tony are being played by different characters in the movie.  I have the Blu-ray 2 disc copy.  The movie is great but the extra and two documentaries are kinda boring.  And the BD-Live never works with my PS3.  Overall, this is a great movie.

review/text: I bought this movie for my friend on his birthday.  We happen to have a projector in our apartment and watching it on there was amazing!  The bigger the screen you have the better the action.  Downey Jr. cannot be beat.  This movie blew everyone away.  Most people thought it would be like every other comic movie, but this one actually has a good plot and good actors.

review/summary: A cool DVD...but if you want 5-stars...go for the two-disc or Blu-ray version!
review/text: I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the "Tales of Suspense" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the "Avengers" and even be this happy child with his "Secret Wars" Iron Man toy.  Years before "IRON MAN" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.  As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that "IRON MAN" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.  This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.  While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.  AUDIO & VIDEO:  The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.  SPECIAL FEATURES:  This "IRON MAN" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.  There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of "IRON MAN" is what is recommended.  After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the "X-Men", "Spider-Man" and the "Fantastic Four" films, there is always the "origin" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.  Fortunately, "Iron Man"did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.  Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.  But definitely enjoyed this film.  With "IRON MAN", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.  But all in all, "IRON MAN" was an enjoyable film for the first version.  A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.  All in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu-ray ultimate edition next!

review/summary: Great Movie - Great Actor
review/text: Picking Robert Downney Jr to play Tony Stark simply guaranteed this movie wouldn't stink........... Downey steals the show without taking away the main character of Tony Stark & the Tin Man as being the center of the story. (ie. some actors are so good, you forget who theyre playing and just pay attention to "them" and not their "character".)  Marvel got it right this time - it's a shame that Incredible Hulk didnt get the same results, nor probably will Punisher WarZone which should have been a straight-to-DVD release. They can redeem themselves if they dont make the world wait 10 years for the Avengers.

review/summary: Iron Man saves superhero movies
review/text: Even as recent as 2006, the super hero sub genre of film had been losing steam. X-men 3 ended up being a joke. Superman Returns was 40 minutes too long and ended up making him a confused and ineffectual moron with a school boy crush that has an illegitimate son. The Fantastic Four movies were too juvenile to be taken seriously and the lord of the new superhero generation, Spiderman, became a jazzy, emotional clown in Spiderman 3.  Longtime and loyal fans were very upset and the uninitiated millions who did not keep up with comics were simply unimpressed. The start of 2008 brought uncertainty for future of these films. The first bastion of hope came in the form of a film adaptation of a rather unknown superhero. Ironman was the story of weapons developer Tony Stark who after receiving a near fatal wound in his chest, creates a super powered suit of armor that allows him to fly and shoot lasers. The teaser trailer to Ironman created a tremendous amount of buzz. Longtime fans were more than excited. They seemed to be almost transformed by the divine touch. Casual movie goers seemed also excited and wanted to finally learn of this strange unpopular character. But as is the usual order of the industry, a good trailer does not ensure a good movie. Some people were skeptical, others hopeful of the movies success and impact. By May of that year everyone got their answer. Ironman opened to world wide acclaim and critical praise.  The movie was a qualified success and gave fans a new hero to rally behind. Unlike earlier efforts by film makers, Ironman delivered its origin story with a healthy sense of character logic and maturity. Gone was the eye winking kitsch and glitz of the past superhero fair. Teenage angst was replaced with middle aged angst and Robert Downey delivered a very confident and nuanced character even before he strapped on the armor. This incredibly kinetic and impossibly agile character was getting down and dirty in warzones that seemed straight out of CNN. This was a different superhero that was facing challenges of our modern world. Considering the current geo-political climate of our time, Ironman was a living breathing sensationalized pop hero critique for our times. The character was a faceless power fantasy vehicle that allowed the viewer to become Ironman and sort of work out their own resolute in a world that doesn't seem to pay attention to the common man. "What would I do with a super powered suit of armor?" Blow up terrorists apparently seemed to be the answer given and audiences loved it.  Unfortunately, the movie degrades from its originally laid out premise of a socially conscious superhero and reverts back to a formulaic climatic battle between Ironman and a "bigger Ironman" as Stark's armor becomes reverse engineered by his closest business ally. This is sort of where Ironman becomes less perfect as it goes for the cheap thrill ending of a battle between two titans which is how most of these movies seem to end anyway. The movie shies away from Ironman really solving this problem as he was so set on bringing an end to terrorism in the first place. Of course it is only the first movie and it ain't comics without a big ol' robot rumble.  Luckily this movie was a great primer for casual fans and had some of the biggest fan service of any of the superhero movies. This movie had tremendous respect for the source material and any changes made in the movie really helped the story along without putting off the fans. If anything, it improved the Ironman premise for this era.  The DVD package is impressive too with a really good amount of behind the scenes extras to keep geeks enamored for hours. A truly special film and DVD that deserves a place in any library.

review/summary: Iron Man - The Awesomeness Never Stops!
review/text: I can really think of only one word to use to review this movie. Awesome! I'm not a big comic book follower, nor am I a super hero geek so I was little worried going into Iron Man that I was going to be left feeling a little out of the loop. There has also been a boatload of press so I was also a little worried that the movie wouldn't live up to all the hype. I was pleasantly surprised.  Iron Man ends up being a 126 minute action packed masterpiece that once it winds up is like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps going and going. The film starts with the introduction to fast talking, suave billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) who is in Afghanistan to show off his company's latest piece of military hardware to the United States Army. En route back from the presentation his convey is ambushed by insurgent rebels and he is taken prisoner. His captors make a deal with him, build them his new missile system and they will give him his freedom. So Tony Stark does what any smart alec, fashionably hip genius would do... build a freaking awesome, super human, punch your guts out robot suit to aide in his escape. Once back on home soil he finds he has a new purpose in life and uses his weapons and inventive genius to target and torment those who are using his weapons for their evil gain.  The plot is fairly cookie cutter and you won't be surprised be any of the twists and turns but that doesn't really detract from the movie. The non stop action doesn't give it a chance to. Once Stark's chest mounted arc reactor is powered up the movie blasts off and you're on the edge of your seat for the ride. Love, allegiance, and morals aren't even enough to stop Iron Man from rocketing from zero to awesome. Sure, they are all mixed into the story but sprinkled in just the right amounts so they don't weigh the story down and turn it into a preachy political mess.  I wouldn't normally refer to a movie as a must see, but if you enjoy action then this one is for you. The acting is fantastic (especially Robert Downey Jr), the action thrill ride punches you square in the chest (hopefully not in your arc reactor), and the entire film just drips with style. I say it's an 8 of 10 and a must see, especially on Blu-ray!

review/summary: Extras Are As Awesome As The Movie
review/text: When I first saw Iron Man in the theaters, it was easily one of my favorite movies. It was definitely my favorite Super Hero movie. I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could see if that feeling remained. Not only did it confirm my initial opinion, but the extras on this DVD gave me a better appreciation of what Jon Favreau did to keep the story of Iron Man as close to the comic book as possible. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome and to see what went behind his performance made me appreciate it more. Now, granted I am a visual effects guy so I am into seeing all of those types of extras. But I think the average Joe will enjoy them as well. I just can't believe how much extra content they were able to squeeze into this package. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to either see Iron Man for the first time or if you are trying to decide between the single disc edition or this one. Spend the few extra bucks for this one. You will be glad you did.

review/text: This is more about Blu-Ray than about the movie, which is super awesome, but in Blu-Ray format rocks! I'm what people call an "early adopter." This means over the years I've tossed Beta VCR's, Windows ME and now my HD-DVD player. HD-DVD was great, it had it all, stunning picture and phenomenal sound. But I have to hand it to Sony (who after dropping the Beta format, I haven't bought anything with the Sony brand since, and my Blu-Ray player is a Panasonic brand) got it right with the Blu-Ray format. Not only is the sound and picture crystal clear but somehow it is actually sharper that HD-DVD. My Blu-Ray player is connected to a Samsung 720 DLP, but I've seen both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD connected to the same a Samsung 46" 1080p LCD and Blu-Ray literally blows HD-DVD away. Again, the movie is fantastic, but if you want the true theater experience, you have to watch it in Blu-Ray with at least 5.1 digital surround sound.

review/summary: Superb Ironman Discs
review/text: I was totally over the moon with the set. The first I hear of this movie was an internet promo with the very cleaned up audio from BLACK SABBATH's song the same title, and  some basic visuals. And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema. Anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish. After reading Ironman in the 70s, he has appeared as everything I wanted. The re-writes in recent years will no doubt try to cheat me of that from what I can gather, but this is something that a long term fan can really get into. The DVD even has some really cool, IPOD style interfaces. The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing. For the first time ever, I totally agree with all the deletes they made on the movie. This one has no commentary, unfortunately, and I think that they could have done one quite easily for total entertainment value.The Ironman Suits from the basic, made from Necessity, to the ones done through Technology, all have the iconic Ironman Appeal.This is one DVD where only the double set will suffice. The extras tell the story that the commentary does not.John Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing. It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work. The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.

review/summary: Iron Man
review/text: Amazing movie, action packed, and exciting.  Robert Downey, Jr. has great comedic timing and sense of sarcasm, yet you also see him develop a sensitivity towards what is really being done with the weapons his character develops.  Jon Favreau has outdone himself, and Jeff Bridges is perfect for Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger.  You've never really seen him as a villain, so this is an interesting turn for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow is amazing- so great as Pepper Potts.  Terrence Howard (Rhodey) supports Downey, Jr. so well- he offers that "down to Earth" behavior that Tony Stark needs to stay grounded himself.

review/summary: Iron Man Blu-ray Review
review/text: This is a great film, and certainly my favorite of all the recent comic book adaptations. The main character is great to watch because of his personality, him not being a typical clean super hero. There are some great funny moments and the effects are great. The quality of this is great for a Blu-ray and with loads of extra features unlike a lot of Blu-rays being put out. While the install to my Ps3 was a touch lengthy to access the BD Live content, it's definitely worth buying.

review/text: From the interactive menus, to the crisp quality of the picture and sound, Iron Man on Blu-ray delivers. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. The menus are based on the computer system of the movie, so you "feel" like your are part of the fun. I highly recommend if you can play blu-rays, get this movie. It would be a key piece - not just to the super hero genre - but for any collector.

review/summary: No he hasnt lost his mind, and yes, he can see... he is not blind
review/text: A little worried about Iron Man being just another so-so Marvel movie, such as Fantastic Four? Well don't be. Actually you can stop reading my review now if you want and get up and go watch this movie.  If you're still here (oh ye of little faith), then I'll try and help you with that tendril of doubt still holding you to your computer chair preventing you to get up and spend the 300 dollars it costs to go see a movie now. 600 if you are taking a date.  Let me first start off with Rob Downey. I for one was hesitant with him being the man who is playing Tony Stark (Iron Man). I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made. Even when I saw the first pics for it. But let me tell you right now... the man IS Tony Stark. He's got this role down. I haven't seen this good of a Downey movie since `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and `Wonder Boys'. At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic. Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit. He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius. He doesn't bash your face in with how smart he is. To show you how smart he is the film shows a bunch of scientists trying to create something that just isn't possible with today's technology. Though Tony Stark was able to do it an Afghan Cave with spare parts from junk.  The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore (can't think of the word for this... sorry). While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story (I promise I haven't ruined anything yet, I told you mostly what you can see in the trailers), lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.  The special effects were used just right. I honestly didn't think they would be able to make Iron Man look that cool or move that cool. Well let me just say, have no fear, because he rocks. From the classic Iron Man suit to the new. The old Iron Man walks just like you think he should, a bulky machine. The new, well, lets just say you would almost not think he's wearing a suit it's so human like, but just enough machine movement to know it's not completely fake looking. I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.  Also the action scenes were great. I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly. The movie isn't action packed but has just enough to not tick you off that there wasn't enough and also not to many to over do it. It was just right. Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.  One last thing I want to say about the actual movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't bad. I'm someone who really isn't fond of her acting. But she plays Pepper Potts, Tony's `assistant/butler... whatever', and she did a really good job. Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.  In the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies! Make sure you stay past the 10 minute credits to see the special ending.  P.S. When you see Iron Man fighting, imagine him being 2 or 3 stories tall. Just imagine it. Now picture him with an Autobot or Decepticon emblem on his chest. Now watch him fight. See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes? Maybe in Transformers 2, Bay will be able to put a coherent fight scene together that the viewers can actually tell what is going on instead of watching a bunch of polygons mish mashing together.

review/summary: Entertaining and Surprisingly Compelling Action Film
review/text: Jon Favreau (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFY">Swingers </a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a>) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMPW">Fantastic Four sequel</a>, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like "that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!"  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.  Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.  One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.  This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it.

There's no denying that the finished suit is the coolest superhero costume ever, and I'm buying this on DVD just to watch the cybernetic Mark III suit morph, flex and create havoc and mass destruction  Downey proves himself to be an excellent choice for the lead role, and although they are unable to steal his thunder, Bridges and Paltrow are pretty darned good themselves.  Howard doesn't have that much screen time, but maybe he'll get his moment in the sequels  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Fantastic! (SPOILERS INCLUDED)
review/text: Wow, what a ride! Iron Man is a blast from beginning to end. I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:  WARNING: SPOILERS Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)  is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life. Girls, booze, parties, he does it all. Standing by his side and cleaning up his various messes is his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Whispering dark thoughts in his ear is his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who you know from the beginning is just not okay.  Tony goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho missile. His convoy is attacked, his American soldier escorts are killed, and he is seriously wounded by shrapnel from one of his very own bombs. He passes out and wakes up as a captive in a Taliban-like camp. His captors want him to make them a Jericho missile, and he is horrified to see that they have a huge stockpile of Stark weapons. How did they acquire them?  With the help of surgeon & fellow captive Dr. Yinsen, Stark makes his first Iron Man suit instead of making the Jericho missile. Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U.S. military. He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home. During Stark's escape, the first Iron Man suit is all but destroyed.  Back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him. The military can't figure out what Stark is, so two F-22 Raptors are called to intercept him. He inadvertently damages one of the planes but saves the pilot. Stark then confesses to his Air Force buddy LC James Rhodes (Terence Howard) that he was the cause of the accident. In addition to playing with his new toy and messing with the military, Stark is also determined to find out why the "bad guys" have so many of his company's weapons.  He unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries. His partner, Obadiah Stane is not pleased and comes up with a suit of his own; he becomes "Iron Monger." You can guess what happens, but suffice it to say the final battle scene between them is everything it should be.  My husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always; he is one of those actors that your eye is naturally drawn to while he's on screen. The rest of the cast is very good in support of him. The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both "Merchant of Death" and "Driving With the Top Down" into my iPod).  Remember: Tony Stark is a grown-up superhero and this is a grown-up action movie. A good bit of it  takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture. Of course it is necessary to the plot, but you should be aware that this may not be the best movie for small children.  Bottom line: Iron Man is a blast of a movie that manages to touch on some real issues we are facing today, but never becomes preachy about it. LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor. Loved it, and can't wait til the DVD is released!!

review/text: Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, "Iron Man" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff. I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic "Spider-Man 3", "Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer", "Ghost Rider" & "Elektra", but "Iron Man" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.  Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: [4.5] Not just a good superhero movie, but a good movie, period.
review/text: Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.  This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.  There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.  The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.  And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.  Acting - 4.5 Action - 4.5 Characters - 4.5 Story - 4.5 Overall - 4.5

review/summary: The Best Film of the Summer?
review/text: Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, "Iron Man" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, "The Incredible Hulk" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.  But I digress. "Iron Man".  Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.  Directed by Jon Favreau ("Elf", "Zathura" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.  "Iron Man" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.  As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.  When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.  Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.  Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.  Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.  Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.  Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.  As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.  "Iron Man" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make "Iron Man" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge "Spiderman" in popularity.

review/summary: So good I'm bothering to review!
review/text: You don't need to be a Marvel fan or even a comic fan at all in order to appreciate the exiting adventure that is Iron Man. It's got the excitement, danger, and the touch of romance that represents the "good movie", all with a lead actor that knows what he's doing.  But the best part about Iron Man, I observed while watching for the second time, is not even the action or the overall plot of the movie, as phenomenal as they are. For me, there's nothing better in the world than a main character that undergoes genuine change, a character you actually care about through and through! Tony Stark is as well-rounded a character as can be, one moment making you laugh and another bringing tears to your eyes through his self realizations, risks, and of course his banter with his personal assistant, the "famous" Pepper Pots.  So, in summary, if you want to watch a movie where you actually care about the characters and the plot resolution, Iron Man is your best bet.

review/summary: Well-crafted filmmaking. Iron Man is INVINCIBLE.
review/text: Jon Faverau's Iron Man is a fast paced action packed adaptation of the Marvel comics comic book. A solid film that effectively balances fantasy in a realistic world, Faverau takes the superhero movie to the next level with his fresh, original vision. He crafts a movie that stays true to the comic book roots but looks and feels so realistic I felt like I was watching real feature film about an original character not an adaptation of a 1960's superhero.  Iron Man follows the story of Tony Stark the son of a munitions manufacturer who s lived in an ivory tower. Enjoying a life of fast cars, fast money and fast women and hard drinks, Stark could care less about the cost his weapons cause to human life as long as he reaps the profits. His perspective on life changes after a trip to Afghanistan where he becomes a victim of his own weapons. With Shrapnel lodged in his heart, a terrorist group known as the ten rings kidnaps him. They demand he makes a weapon for them. Paired with Yinsen, another kidnap victim, Stark begins work on first the Arc reactor and then an Iron Man to help his escape.  Back in the states Stark perfects his armor, not without a few hilarious disasters in the lab. He creates the Mark II silver-plated riveted suit that is far more powerful than the Mark I, but can't go into high altitudes. (Time for a refractory coating.) While designing the Mark III stark creates a gold Titanium Pollyalloy suit (a reference to the golden armor) and paints it red. With the suit perfected, he heads to Afghanistan for a little revenge. (Want to know how Tony flew halfway around the world? He flew all the way up into the Earth's upper atmosphere then flew back down. He did this in the comics to go from L.A. to New York and From L.A to Russia Back in the 1980's. Unfortunately this leads to a run in with some US Jets in thrilling action sequence ripped straight from a Bob Layton panel.  The leaders of the Ten Rings find the remains of the Mark I and inform Stane. Stane finds the remains of the Mark I and is eager to get it functioning. He builds his own Iron Monger He confronts stark in his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest. Stark uses his old arc reactor to have an epic battle with Stane taken from an Iron Man Comic- I'm not giving anymore away- THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.  As a longtime fan of Iron Man I'm delighted with this movie. Faverau's movie is a translation of the all my favorite Iron Man comic books to film. Starks house on the coast is just like the one he had in the second David Michilene/Bob Layton run of the book. Mark I looks just like it stepped off the pages of Tales of Suspense #39. The mark II reminds me of the old golden armor and all its flaws The Mark III armor is taken straight from the pages of Adi Granov's Extremis run of Iron Man. Jarvis is just like Homer from the Kaminiski/Hopgood run and the Animated series. There's just so much fanboy goodness in this movie.  There is only one word to describe the acting in this film: SUPERB. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. I love the way he plays tony as a cocky, ladies man without a care in the world. Downey's best scenes are with some CGI robots; I love these because he acts just like these robots are people. Jeff Bridges takes his acting to the next level as Obidiah Stane. He steals scenes as the bad guy; it's hard to believe this was the same guy who was in Dumb and Dumber years ago. Terrence Howard is great as Rhodey, his laid-back low key character is a great contrast to tony. Gwyneth Paltrow shines as Pepper Potts. Samuel L. Jackson is a solid Nick Fury.  Iron Man is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Movie. Take your Superhero movies to the next level. Get t this along With Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Incredible Hulk Director's cut and Superman: The Movie.

review/summary: Should actually be Gold-Titanium Man
review/text: Finally, a comic-book movie for the 21st century.  Our hero has his flaws; a passion for dumb women and an awkwardness with smart ones.  Our villain has a believable motive; greed, and represents a realistic threat to society, the military - industrial complex.  Iron Man also has a female sidekick who does know his true identity.  And best of all, our hero is not suffused with enough humility to keep his identity under wraps.  What a great movie!  The only flaws were some of the action scenes in which Iron Man takes quite a pounding.  Yes, the suit kept the man whole, but any person going thru those types of G-forces would suffer internal bleeding at a lethal level.

I would want to be him. I want to see a lot of iron man sequels. Iron Man man looks awesome and perfect and they give him a lot of really great poses. He also has the best flying sequences that I've ever seen. The visual artists who worked on this movie are certifiable geniuses! Seriously! I like Iron Man soooo much better than that wimpy, disgusting crybaby Spiderman (who should be called spiderwussy instead). Iron Man actually kills the bad guys, unlike Spiderwussy. Also Iron Man gets much hotter women than Kirsten Dunst (who is lame!). I think I would like about 20 sequels to Iron Man, at least!

review/summary: The real man of steel; err, um, iron...
review/text: From the moment that `Iron Man' began I knew that this was going to be a fun ride.  My wife and I were talking recently about how the whole concept behind superhero movies has really shifted focus in recent years.  The major studios have realized that more than just teenage boys go to see these movies; and while there are still critical clunkers and high octane action popcorn munching fluff films thrown into the mix; there are also a slew of very intelligent and dramatic superhero films to come out recently.  While `Iron Man' may lack the moral dilemmas that made `The Dark Knight' one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, it definitely earns a spot next to `Spider-Man 2' as one of the most exciting and most watchable superhero movies in recent memory.  We can all get on our knees and thank Robert Downey Jr. for that.  From the opening scene, where Tony Stark is conversing rather charismatically with soldiers while crossing the desert, Downey Jr. embodied his character with so much natural charm that we were sucked in.  He was funny, he was touching, he was bold, he was confident, he was vulnerable, he was angry; he was all of these things throughout the course of this film, and each emotion was portrayed effortlessly.  He understood each avenue of his characters development and he worked very hard to create a man out of Iron Man.  The film starts with a savage attack that leaves Stark in the hands of terrorists that want him to build for them his newly designed superweapon.  Instead, he builds himself a supersuit that enables him to escape with his life.  After witnessing the atrocities that his company has helped create (he builds weapons for war) he decides that he doesn't want his legacy to be mere death but he wants to do something meaningful with his life.  That's when Iron Man is born.  The film, much like `Batman Begins' and the first `Spider-Man' film, focuses mostly on Stark's transformation from man to hero.  We see him struggle with his secrets and his plans, not knowing who to trust since everyone who appears to be on his side also appears to be using him for their own gain.  His decision to stop making weapons comes as a blow to the company and to his partner, Obadiah Stane, and it places him on a rocky path with his friend Rhodey, so Stark finds himself secluded and alone as he attempts to create something huge from his very noble idea.  We get to see Stark grow as a person, and thus become a hero on the inside before truly becoming one in the flesh.  The performances here are all wonderful, each and every one.  Downey Jr. owns this movie (this was such a great year for him) but he is helped along by a wonderfully talented cast.  First, we have Jeff Bridges.  This man is gold to me, and here he is just brilliant.  Not only is he dashing in every scene (I really want his wardrobe) but he is also engaging and intriguing (and he has the best character arc).  Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous here as well.  She has received lots of good press for this performance, and rightfully so.  She is the typical conflicted best girl to the hero, but she plays it with such fresh spunk.  Terrence Howard is also very good here.  I'm not a usual fan, but he sold me and I'm actually a little upset they are replacing him with Don Cheadle (I am a huge fan of Cheadle by the way) for the sequel.  The film is not as `important' as say `The Dark Knight' was.  `The Dark Knight' was a rare gem in the genre, exposing raw humanity within its scope; but Batman is a much different breed of superhero than Iron Man is.  Marvel comics were never as dark as DC, thus the colorful and action filled approach taken to films like `Spider-Man' and `Iron Man'.  Director Jon Favreau (who also co-stars) does a splendid job of making every scene bounce, giving it this vibrant energy that keeps the audience hooked from the very beginning.  This is a truly enjoyable and memorable superhero movie, filled with effortless charisma, engaging action and truly inspired performances.  This has been a great year for superheros.

review/summary: Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark
review/text: WARNING SPOILERS WARNING  On the surface the script for Iron Man is simple and basic.  We find out the origin of Iron Man, how he builds the suit and a major villain arrives with a similar suit to challenge him.  Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat.  What makes this 'comic book' movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.  Robert Downey Jr.  I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back story.  I knew him but never really was into him except when the story revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life.  While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book.  Quite simply, like Heath Ledger as The Joker, you don't see Downey Jr. on the screen but Tony Stark.  Yes, he's that good.  Whoever casted Downey for this movie deserves a raise or % of the profits because without him the movie doesn't excel.  Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie don't inspire the audience.  Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr.  Sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role.  Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general.  One of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made.  ***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION

review/summary: Simple, But Amazing
review/text: Of all the comic book movies out there, "Iron Man" ranks as one of THE best. I was surprised to hear that Jon Favreau was directing it and he couldn't have done a better job. Robert Downey, Jr. IS Tony Stark and Favreau is the only one who could've done the job. "Iron Man" not only excels as a great super hero movie, but as a great movie. Even though the plot is predictable and very simple, at the same time it's funny, dramatic, and it's full of heart, and it's all because we have a great story and a perfect cast to play it out. "Iron Man" takes a modern approach to the origin of the hero. Instead of 'Nam, Stark has his accident in the middle east, in Afghanistan. We get to see the Ten Rings (who kidnap Stark) and some references are made to Iron Man's arch-nemesis, the Mandarin. I won't go into the story (you'll have to see it!) but I will say the story plays out great, and we have some great acting from Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges. Downey definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this one. The special effects are fantastic; the final showdown is a good example. It's amazing how they actually built a functional Iron Man suit to use instead on relying solely on CGI. The action sequences are beautifully orchestrated and there's not too much or too little. There's plenty of laughs and many dramatic moments and again, I can't give the cast enough cred. Plus, for fans of the comics, there an awesome scene at the end of the credits. Now, for the review on the 2-Disc DVD set. This "Ultimate 2 Disc Set" delivers the goods. The first disc features the main film in all its glory and the deleted/extended scenes that definitely needed to be cut. The 2nd disc includes a great 7-part "Making Of" documentary that goes into great depth at the filmmaking process of Iron Man. There's also a 45 minute documentary about the character's origins in the comics. And then, there's a funny clip from "The Onion" and some videos featuring some screen tests, a look at the visual effects, and photo galleries. This DVD set is the one to get and it's worth the money. Overall, "Iron Man" is a fantastic film and is a must see and it's worth watching over, and over, and over again!

review/summary: THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN!
review/text: 2008 has been a banner year for movies from my point of view, and one of the highest points was IRON MAN. There have been a lot of comic-book adaptations in the past few years, and there are a lot more coming. Unlike those seen in past decades, the more recent set of adaptations have been in general good-to-great, with even the worse ones generally reaching at least the level of mediocre-watchable (as opposed to the depths reachable only by abominations such as, say, the Captain America movie made about 15 years ago).  Iron Man is at the top of this pretty impressive heap. One of the things it manages to do is keep most of the ORIGINAL Iron Man origin, something I was sure that they would dump or, worse, screw up. While the details were, and had to be, changed (for instance, the original Iron Man started out as a POW in Viet Nam, if I recall correctly), the essence of the origin is the same. Into this they also seamlessly integrate a MOTIVE for carefree playboy Tony Stark's conversion into a hero willing to risk himself personally in battle for other people.  Downey's portrayal of Stark is letter-perfect, in some ways possibly even better than Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man/Peter Parker -- which is saying quite a bit, as the first two Spider-Man movies basically set the bar for modern superhero movies, and set it very high. Stark is a patriot, but also a super-wealthy and successful genius who likes playing with his money, entertaining himself with beautiful women (and never committing to them) and basically doesn't bother to think much about the potential dark side of the weapons manufacturing that Stark Industries does best. Despite his apparently worldly ways, Tony Stark is -- actually -- very much an innocent, an adult with the impulses and idealism of a child.  And when he discovers how very badly his own creations are being abused, he has the same outraged fury that any young person has when some of their most cherished and fundamental beliefs are shattered.  But unlike 99.999% of children, Tony Stark can DO something about it. And after going through a personal hell that shatters and rebuilds him, he decides that he WILL do something about it.  And then things start to get ugly.  The first movie in a known-character series like this -- Spider-Man, X-Men, etc. -- usually suffers from Origin Syndrome. You have to spend time introducing us to the main character, setting up what they're like, give them their origin, lead them into a problem, and then if you're lucky spend the last forty-five minutes actually doing the superheroing that is (presumably) the draw.  Iron Man DOESN'T suffer from this. Partly this is because unlike most of the other superheroes, Iron Man isn't a victim of chance, a fortunate or cursed person who got the right genes, got bitten by the right spider, was gifted by gods at a whim with strange powers beyond those of mortal men. Iron Man is literally a self-made man. He becomes a hero by the power of his own mind and resources; he decides to become a hero because he's seen that a hero is needed, and that decision and the process involved is part of what makes this movie WORK, and work well.  Another reason this movie doesn't suffer in the origin sequence is that Tony and his situation are more familiar to us in the real world. He isn't fighting mutants with wierd powers (that have to be explained, just like the hero's), or psychos with a personal issue (that needs to be brought up in detail). He's a familiar figure, a powerful and wealthy man who suddenly finds that his own mighty empire is corrupt, and he needs to fight against THAT. His issues are front page news here, with only slight changes to names. So there is no need to waste much time explaining; we can understand what he is, what his enemies are, and so on. The only thing we DON'T see in this world is..  ... the Armor. And of course, THAT is the other great star of Iron Man. We have finally reached the point where that amazing super-suit of armor can be believably created on-screen, and it's clear that someone spent a very, very long time trying to MAKE it believable (just one example; when Tony flies with the suit, you can see the suit's general configuration SHIFT with flight direction, speed, etc. -- just as a real flying vehicle has to shift its configuration with flaps, etc. in order to maintain good flight characteristics).  Even more interestingly, the movie avoids some of the nastiness and grotesquerie which could easily have been present in some of the sequences, leaving this a movie I don't feel uncomfortable letting my (older) kids watch.  I sure hope that the sequel, and currently planned connecting movies, do not disappoint.

review/summary: The Best Superhero Movie So Far!
review/text: I've heard--and read--so many disparaging remarks regarding superhero movies, as if they're somehow inferior to "real" movies--what is a REAL movie, anyway? A low-budget indie full of miserable people? I think the characterization in Iron Man, like the Spider-Man franchise, is very good. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. No one else could have brought this character to life as he has. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is true to the comic book--or is it "graphic novel" now? I'm never quite sure! The story never bogs down. The special effects are spectacular. Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.  I only gave it four stars instead of five because I was disappointed to find, in all the extras included in the 2-disc set, there was no BLOOPER REEL!!!!

review/summary: One of the best super hero movies ever made
review/text: Most people on Amazon -- and I count myself among them -- reviewing movies or TV shows primarily review the film or series and not the product.  As a rule, I think this is more helpful than focusing on features, extras, packaging, and such.  Because these change and usually (though not always) Amazon links the old versions to the new, comments about these can become irrelevant.  I am making an exception to this product, the Blu-ray 2-disc edition of IRON MAN, simply because it is the first movie that I bought on Blu-ray.  I previously had bought two TV series on Blu-ray, but this is the first film.  I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3, primarily for watching movies, though secondarily for playing games.  I limiting my Blu-ray purchases until the prices for the discs come down to around the same level as DVDs.  On the other hand, I'm virtually cutting out my purchases of DVDs entirely, since the new format is already on hand.  I wouldn't be surprised if overall DVD sales started to drop if more people follow the kinds of buying patterns I'm currently practicing.  We are in an in between period.  The format war is over and Blu-ray has won, but not enough people own Blu-ray players because they are priced too high.  But just as I stopped purchasing LPs and cassette tapes once CDs were released, so I'm ceasing buying DVDs.  But my purchasing of Blu-ray is minimal.  Mostly I rent from Netflix.  Which leads to the question, why buy Blu-ray at all?  Well, only if there is enough in the product to justify it.  In the case of IRON MAN, I believe what you get justifies the cost.  I was a little nervous the first time I put a Blu-ray on, wondering if the difference was going to justify the money I had expended.  I'm delighted to say that it did.  The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.  But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu-ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high-def.  I think this will change quickly as Blu-ray matures as a form, but currently many releases have the main feature in 1080 high def, but many of the features in a lower resolution.  IRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.  Too often special features just seem to be filler, put there to make the purchaser that there is more to the item purchased than there is.  And frankly, more often than not I don't bother with special features at all.  But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.  Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies -- even most very good movies -- is not terribly interesting.  But in the case of a high-tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.  I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.  I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.  IRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.  After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.  The goal is ultimately an Avengers movie and to that end they are bringing out a string of movies over the next 3 or 4 years, introducing potential new members of the Marvel answer to the JLA.  We have already been introduced to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and I hope everyone who has watched IRON MAN stuck around after the closing credits to be introduced to Nick Fury, who gets his own movie something early in the next decade -- this will almost certain star Samuel L. Jackson, who gave his permission to serve as the model for Fury in The Ultimate Nick Fury comic release).  Marvel has announced movies based on Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man, all of whom were members of the Avengers in one or another version, along with Iron Man and the Hulk.  Marvel's formula, based on IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, as well as the movies they are striving to cast (the word is that Daniel Craig recently turned down the offer to star in THOR), is to make a character based film focused primarily on a high-profile actor (Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton, and if he had taken the offer Daniel Craig), and then build the action around him, instead of having the character as an afterthought to the action.  It has worked wonderfully in the Spider-Man movies (which was primarily a Sony production).  When and if they do an Avengers movie, the cost of the cast alone should be jaw dropping.  However, Marvel isn't focusing on the Avengers alone.  They have also announced their intention to do a film based on my own favorite Marvel series, Brian K. Vaughan's The Runaways, about a group of empowered teens in California who discover that their parents are super villains, causing them to become runaways (hence their name).  Though the Runaways have been tangentially included in Marvel Big Events like the Civil War and the Secret Invasion, they aren't centrally involved in the rest of the Marvel Universe.  There will also be a Silver Surfer film, hopefully with Galactus as his foe.  My fear is that Marvel is going to be exclusively focused on producing titanic box office smashes.  Though I will add that both IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK focus on character enough to make both far more than cinematic comic books.  My last comment is that as a Robert Downey Jr. admirer, I couldn't be happier that he seems to have conquered his personal demons to enjoy the greatest commercial success of his career.  He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.  Although he proudly points out that even during the years when he struggled with drug addiction and never missed a single day of shooting on any film, after his final rehab and jail stint insurers would not insure his films.  I know that Woody Allen had to drop him from one project because they couldn't get insurance for him.  Gradually, however, he managed to work his way back.  He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.  Like Downey earlier in his life, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism.  The film only shows him drinking.  I wonder if IRON MAN 2, which was just announced, will show Stark dealing with his drinking.  I hope so.  It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.  Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.  The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.

review/summary: Iron-Clad Action Movie
review/text: Batman and Spider-Man beware: there's a new hero in town and though he may not have all those "wonderful toys" or be able to throw sticky webs, he's packing a serious arsenal.  Born from the imaginations of Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and penciled by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby in 1963, "Iron Man" is the second Marvel Comic hero come to life on the big screen this year.  Boasting big names (Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard) and even bigger visual effects to boot (courtesy of the illustrious Industrial Light and Magic), "Iron Man" was the box office grand slam of late spring 2008 and upon viewing it's easy to see why.  The film doesn't waste much time before it jumps right into the action and gives us a keen character establishment of its main man.  Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is a man made rich off his father's munitions business of Stark Industries and lives rather recklessly as a result, cavorting about the world in private jets and expensive cars, bedding beautiful women and drinking at all hours of the day.  Beneath a seemingly spoiled rich boy exterior lies an astounding brain for engineering, Stark's company reaching new and glorious heights with his brilliant fabrications of innovative and powerful weapons for the US military.  When he travels to Afghanistan for a dramatic unveiling of his new "Jericho" missile, his small convoy is ambushed and he is taken prisoner by Afghan radicals.  Rigging his heart to a device that would mean certain death if he dismantled it, they order him to replicate the Jericho missile for their own purposes in exchange for his release.  Knowing he's a dead man no matter whether he accepts or refuses the terms, Tony sets to work on his greatest design yet, something that brings meaning to the saying "necessity is the mother of invention".  Breaking free from a desert cave in a colossal suit made of metal, Stark blasts the baddies and returns home to America with a renewed perspective, determined to veer off his long course of war profiteering.  Something's afoot however and Stark encounters a curious amount of resistance to his plan from business partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges).  While the fragments of truth slowly piece together, Stark perfects his original design and with the help of his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) keeps the project hush-hush while testing its limitations and using its power to right the many wrongs that Stark Industries has caused.  Being a comic book adaptation, you can expect some impressive visual effects from "Iron Man" and you get them in spades.  Not only do we see the streamlined red and gold suit in CGI but some of the fun parts are watching Stark piece it together in his vast workshop as well as test its radical capabilities (he gets comically blown into the wall more than once testing its rocket thrusters).  No greater magic can be felt than when a superhero takes flight and there are plenty of heartracing aerial stunts that have Iron Man soaring far and wide through the clouds and the stars, as well as taking treacherous falls from thousands of feet back to Earth.  The mere concept and engineering of the suit will get some mental gears turning, for in this age of rampant and advancing technology one can only wonder whether such a wondrous contraption is conceivable.  Downey Jr. is the man of the hour as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the 43-year old actor relishing the extravagant playboy persona of his character and excelling in the dramatic scenes where Stark sees the cause and effect of his profession.  He also made a figurative iron man of himself, sculpting his body with vigorous weight training (five days a week) and martial arts.  He is a literal phoenix of the entertainment industry, risen from the ashes of drug abuse and bad press to come back full swing and win over audiences and jaded film critics once again.  Also noteworthy is Bridges as the villanous Obadiah Stane, rendered almost unrecognizable with his bald head and full salt-and-pepper beard.  He takes to his bad guy role quite well and doesn't disappoint in his climactic battle with Stark.  Paltrow, a critical darling and a great actress, is an odd choice for the role of Pepper Potts, her stiff performance going right along with her stiff traipsing in all those tight, restrictive skirts and stilettos she wears.  Her scenes with Downey Jr. where they are playfully bantering are engaging but when portraying terror, she falls flat.  Why she was chosen for this role is anyone's guess.  Another waste of talent is Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's close friend and confidante.  Howard can act the hell out of a dramatic role (just watch "Crash" and "Hustle & Flow" and you'll see what I'm talking about) but nary a hint of his capabilities is revealed here, another headscratcher of a casting choice.  Director Jon Favreau (an actor turned director) does an admirable job in the driver's seat with this big-budget feature ($140 million), recouping the cost and them some when the film made over $300 million domestically.  He has already signed on for a sequel, as have Downey Jr. and Paltrow.  It will be interesting to see whether he can be on par with or surpass Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" juggernaut.  Bottom line: Be you an action movie fan or a lover of superhero fables, "Iron Man" will entertain you in more ways than one with its non-stop action, engaging story and charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr.

review/summary: Reference Quality Blu-ray Fun For The Whole Family
review/text: I was unable to catch Iron Man in the theatre during the summer and so I was waiting for this on Blu-ray quite anxiously. I was pretty confident that it would be good picture and sound as Marvel has yet to make a disappointing Blu release, but I was blown away by Iron Man! This is the definition of a reference disc! Flawless 1080P picture, lossless audio that lets you hear every little nuance of sound from the explosions in Afghanistan, to the ice freezing to the Mark II suit on its first flight. If you want the true theatre-at-home experience, this disc will definitely bring it to you!  Downey is a great actor and a great portrayal of the troubled Stark, he comes off as a complete natural throughout the whole film. The supporting roles are all filled by extremely talented cast and that is what sets this movie aside from previous Marvel films like the Spiderman films or HULK, which rely too much on the superhero factor and don't seem to worry too much about the cast.  Oh and this definitely is not a movie that should be limited to any specific audience as it is something I would watch with anyone from a little brother to a friend, my mother or grandmother, it is an enjoyable, reasonably realistic film for just about anyone.

review/summary: Movie Does Play...Eventually
review/text: First off, I was not disappointed when I saw this movie in the theaters.  Pretty good story arc, believable characters.  A little slow at times, reminded me of Superman Returns,  The problem I have with my purchase is I was expecting to be bowled out of my chair by the audio.  Compared to the audio effects and low-end bass found in Transformers, Iron Man was kind of a let down (use of all channels was fine/transfer was nice)  The scene where Stark demos the Jericho was a major disappointment (had to crank my receiver).  Anyway, as a whole the movie was fine, but I think people should rent it first, not only because of the known issues with compatibility, but simply to make sure this is a movie you'll watch again.  I'm fairly certain that now that I've seen it twice, I'll be skipping through the slow areas.

review/summary: A solid movie, could have used just a bit more action
review/text: There have been many good adaptations of comic book stories coming to theatres lately; it's truly a golden age for the super hero on the silver screen.  Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.  The basic story is about a great industrialist who gets out of weapons manufacturing and into costumed heroism, having a change of heart after he spends some time imprisoned by warlords who have been acquiring his company's weapons.  This character turn had the potential to become preachy and obnoxious, but the movie wisely limits the peacenik blabbering to one minor character encountered early in the film.  The movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.  Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.  Unfortunately, there is really only one scene in which we see him use the suit to its full capacity.  The film would have benefitted from one more big action sequence at that point in the story, or at least extending the scene we do have.  As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger-than-life billionaire playboy persona.  However, when he is constrained to trudge through plot-advancing dialogue, or when he has to share a more personal moment with another character, he seems to lose all his charm in an instant.  But hey, if my biggest complaint is that I wanted more of a good thing, the movie must be doing alot of things right.  I solidly recommend it.  PQ: Blu-Ray picture quality was very good.  The only distracting digital noise I observed was when we see from a point-of-view inside the suit, which was clearly deliberate.  The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.  The dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.  Overall I would say the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.

review/summary: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?
review/text: Iron Man accomplishes what I heretofore thought was impossible: it makes the first act of the hero's origin story (before he attains his powers) the most enjoyable part of a comic book movie.  Tony Stark is a guiltless hedonist living the ultimate playboy lifestyle with narcissistic charm and dexterity. As a rich weapons manufacturer, he indulges in high technology, gleefully treats objects like women (a Big Lebowski reference for you Jeff Bridges fans) and flies in a private jet packed with strippers and booze.  As 'Back In Black' blares on a stereo system, he boasts of his company's latest devastating firepower available for sale to the U.S. military. It is at this time that a group of Afghani terrorists obliterate his convoy and take the fatally wounded Stark hostage. It seems he is needed to build a missile for them; the twist being that it is a weapon he himself designed.  The only way his heart can be kept beating is by keeping it connected to a crude battery unit. In a terrifically suspenseful sequence, Stark stalls for time so he can build an iron suit capable of protecting him from bullets and explosions while he wipes out his captors.  Upon returning to L.A. (in an unlikely rescue), Stark decides to stop developing weapons and live a nobler lifestyle (which is no fun). However, Jeff Bridges (the requisite confidant-turned-archenemy) has other ideas and battles against Stark's newfound idealism while secretly creating his own goliath suit; presumably because all bad guys in these movies crave Ultimate Power.  Robert Downey Jr. is the producers' ace-in-the-hole. Without him this would be just another mediocre entry in the long line of cookie-cutter Marvel films. His performance hits you like a shot of pure oxygen. He is the slick, supercool badass with snappy one-liners we all wish we could be. Even when the plot falls apart, Downey's mere presence makes the onscreen nonsense bearable (and, at times, hardly noticeable).  The rest of the bland cast isn't worth mentioning. After Stark constructs his true Iron Man suit and the obvious reveal of Jeff Bridges as the villain, there's nowhere left to go except the inevitable showdown. Or so the screenwriters have surmised. The remainder of Iron Man's running time is a tedious, disappointing affair.  My personal preference would have been for Stark to simply fight terrorism across the globe without the stale conflict of Jeff Bridges' character (especially because Bridges' dialogue eventually becomes cartoonishly rotten, even for this type of movie). There's a scene where this happens and it's the last time Iron Man provides a refreshing antidote to the typical mundane style of storytelling prevalent in Marvel's blockbuster features.  At least the audience can rightfully expect a better sequel from the brave, abrupt surprise ending.

review/summary: Iron Man......
review/text: Superhero movies seem to be the rage these days. With movies like Iron Man, I can see why. Not that I'm complaining. If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me. True, I'm an admitted DC fanboy but I, occasionally, get into Marvel Comics as well. Honestly, though, I've never been into Iron Man as much as I have others like Blade, The Punisher, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange. You can tell by my favorites there that I'm into the darker, more twisted likes of Marvel's gallery. Yet, after seeing Iron Man, I've decidedly thought about purchasing his comic on a regular basis now. The movie is about Tony Stark. A wealthy industrialist who is kidnapped to build a destructive weapon for the enemy. If things weren't bad enough, shrapnel works its way near his heart and the only thing keeping him alive is a small electromagnetic generator installed in his chest.  Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by. After escaping, he decides to turn his life and company around much to the disappointment of Obadiah Stane(his second in command at Stark Industries). Obadiah wants complete control over Stark Industries, even if it means wiping out Tony Stark and that's when things start to get interesting. Without giving too much away, let's just say things get wayyy more interesting from that point.  In my honest opinion, Iron Man is Marvel's first movie into more 'serious' material. Not one time in the movie did I find things too unbelievable or fantastical as some of their previous movies led me to feel. Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.  Directed by Jon Favreau; the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. Extras include:Trailers(Star Trek, Indiana Jones & The Incredible Hulk), Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion "Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).  All in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.

review/summary: "So you are a man who has everything but nothing..don't waste your life"-Terrific looking movie with metal head's origin
review/text: PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS MY OPINION DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN OR PURCHASED THE MOVIE--YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY. IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.  THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM THANKS!  "Titanium Composite Man" just doesn't have the same ring to it as "Iron Man". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is "The Merchant of Death" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.  He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).  The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.  The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary "I AM Iron Man" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette "Invincible Iron Man" that gives us an idea about the development of the character with interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, "Wired" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film.  Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of "The Dark Knight" (that "Iron Man" is really Marvel's idea of "Batman" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the "Spider-Man" films directed by Sam Raimi.  The nice thing about "Iron Man" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).  Marvel's first in-house production "Iron Man" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or DVD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third "Iron Man" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of "The Incredible Hulk".  Highly recommended!

review/text: Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assisstant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!

review/text: I'm not from SoCal, so I can't comment on the BK product placement (which was so obvious as to be perhaps intentionally ludicrous?) I would definitely go for In-and-Out waaaay before BK, whether or not I'd been in an Afghani cave for 3 months.  I've never read the comic book, and never been that much into them anyway. This is definitely not the semi-plausible superhero (Batman) nor is it the completely implausible (X-Men). That leaves the techno-superheroes: Iron Man. I'm not sure which I find more implausible. But I must admit a buff Robert Downey Jr. is better eye candy than Toby McGuire. That, of course, could easily lead to a super-hero comparison via the eye-candy factor.  What seemed a bit lurching was the pace of the beginning and end. The beginning is slow, but not unpleasantly ('get to know the cast of characters and understand the hero's tragic flaws'). But it seemed to be rushing towards the end - fast paced action, sure - but this seemed like someone abruptly realized it was already min.120 and counting, and had to hurry to end it.  Sad, because I was still enjoying it.  Downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit. A childish joy immediately squashed by Newtonian physics. Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).  Script?  ok Direction?  ok FX?  good Robert Downey?  totally makes the movie.  He inhabits the part.  Nothing else is really that spectacular, but you don't notice being so engrossed with him.  Elizabeth's rating: 2 The special effects are better on the big screen

review/summary: Great edition to Comic Book movies!!!
review/text: Now this was a great movie, they did an awesome job with it and everyone I know enjoyed watching this movie.  There was someone here who mentioned Full Screen. I just wanted to say Yo Dude spend for a better TV, Full screen cuts the original format and you are only seeing part of the film. And this Movie is one where you don't want to miss anything. The increase size is probably for the flying scenes where they need more room to show off the Suits abilities. This movie is Iron Man after all. (no disrespect intended) A great example of what I am talking about would be the difference between the full screen and wide screen versions of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The scene where Indy and his father are driving the motorcycle. You miss so much of the interaction between the two in the Full Screen Version.  But review is about Iron Man so back to the review. The acting was great and Robert Downey Jr looks just like Stark in the comics.  The suit is awesome and the special effects added nicely to the movie to help complement the scenes.  This movie is worth it.  If you liked the comics then you should like this movie.  Just sit back an enjoy. =^_^=

review/summary: Very impressive
review/text: Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by "Marvelizing" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.  The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.

review/summary: Better Every Time I Watch It
review/text: To quote/paraphrase a line from the movie (no, this gives nothing away); "my father created weapons in the hope that they would not have to be fired.  I respectfully disagree.  The best weapon is the kind you only have to fire ONCE."  All I had to do was see Iron Man once, and I was utterly hooked on it.  To further my impression of the movie before I plunge into the actual review, I will say this; I have seen the movie IN THEATRES five times.  I paid every single time, and not only that, I plan on buying the special edition disk set.  One hopes that will give you some indication of how good the movie really is for the diehard Marvel fan.  I admit, I had my doubts.  It'd been a long time since I'd seen Mr. Downey Jr in a film, and Ms. Paltrow as well, come to think of it.  I've been suffering through renditions of how directors and producers saw Spider-Man, assiduously avoiding The Fantastic Four franchise because I didn't want to see the F4 being mutilated along with the Silver Surfer...but Iron Man completely restored my faith in a director's ability to cut through the "SPECIAL EFFECTS FIGHT SCENES MAKE THE MOVIE!" crap that so many directors of today suffer from, most fatally.  Mr. Downey Jr BECOMES Tony Stark, brilliant alcoholic multi-millionaire.  He is so believable that when I bring him up in conversation, I don't say "Mr. Downey Jr was great in that scene," I saw "wow, Tony did really well right there!"  He submerged himself and became, instead of simply acted, his role.  It was beautiful to watch.  It is rare than an actor of Mr. Downey Jr's considerable talent finds a role that suits him so perfectly, that allows him to be so expressive, that makes him truly become one of the best actors of this decade, if not this generation.  I could easily wax more eloquent on the abilities of Mr. Downey Jr, but that would defeat the purpose of this review, so I will continue.  Simply put, the plot of this movie and the origins of Iron Man synchronize without rough edges, and the characters are utterly believable humans with human motives and flaws.  The actors and actresses in this movie are flawless and the dialogue is engaging and humorous.  This movie is well worth the money to own, or in my case, to see five times and then proceed to ownership.  Give it a try!  You will not regret it.

review/summary: He is Iron Man
review/text: With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman</a>, super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on "Iron Man," they've done something totally new. "Iron Man" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.  A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.  The suits do battle and it's better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a> fights (which were both done by the same company). The other "training exercise" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)  Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)  All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR">Tron</a>, a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?  I also have to - as everyone else here has stated - remind everyone: stay through the credits. "Iron Man" kicks the summer blockbuster season off with a bang.

review/summary: Best Superhero Award
review/text: So many folks are doubting Downey's ability to pull off "superhero".  Well, now hopefully all doubts are allayed.  The movie was spectacular.  Not just in comparison to this year's meager pickings; but Iron Man stands on its own legs.  (quite literally)  This movie is not just another superhero-comic book rip off.  It's writing at its best.  Ok...so it had cool gadgets; great cars; funny jokes and a  formulaic plot line---but don't let that deter you.  This flick was worth more than the price of three admissions.  In  a nutshell, this film had everything for all people.  If you read just a bit between the sheets; the antiwar anti bureaucracy undertones satisfy even the most left wing of liberals.  The rah rah Americanism will please the hard line neo-cons and the gadgets and firestorm Fx will appeal to geeks and kids alike.  Best of all, this movie had heart.  If you weren't already a Downey fan, you probably were by the time you left the theatre.  Robert Downey Jr. seems the embodiment of Tony Stark as  every man's superhero.  Downey/Stark represents the dichotomy that lives inside of each of us.  Both playboy and public servant, you couldn't help but love and pity and relate to him, all at the same time.

review/summary: "The truth is, I am Iron Man."
review/text: Get ready to be entertained folks! I was preparing myself to be somewhat disappointed. After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast. ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.  So, getting to the "main course" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to "sell" his new "bang, bang" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for "the enemy" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity...."the suite" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.  Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has "alternate" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.  Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future. Well worth seeing for the theater experience, this is not one to miss folks. Saddle up for some hard hitting action and a bitch'in good time.

review/text: I am not a fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is a great actor in this role. Tony Stark (Iron man), a scientist specialized in weapon development, is kidnapped by terrorists, and during his hostage, he creates an Iron man to his escape and soon the Iron man becomes his new identity.  Upon his return, he decides to lead himself to a new direction but a weapon developer. His decision accidentally moves him closer to unveil a nasty truth and also exposes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Paltrow) in danger.  The character of Iron man fits Robert Downey Jr. who is not afraid of authority, witty, brilliant, and ultimately makes this flick a gem.  Iron man definitely brings a different atmosphere amongst the superheros who are usually low-profile and secretive such as superman, batman, and spiderman. Additionally, Iron man shows himself in box office just in a right time since we are a tad fed up with the aforementioned superhero sequels. (at least I am ...)

review/summary: "Iron Man" is excellent!
review/text: "Iron Man" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor who is kidnapped and forced to build a devastating weapon. Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high-tech suit of armor and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. The cast led by  Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career-defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent! The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed "Elf" (2003), "Zathura" (2005), & "Made" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on characters by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby) by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby (both who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for "Children Of Men" (2006), Art Marcum, & Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming "Punisher: War Zone" (2008) is excellent! The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to "Mr. Brooks" (2007) & the tv show "Prison Break") is excellent! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to "The Number 23" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to "Elf" & "Zathura") is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to "Vantage Point" (2008), "Never Back Down" (2008), & the upcoming "You Don't Mess With The Zohan" (2008) is excellent! The production design by J. Michael Riva (who also did the production design to "Zathura" & "Spider-Man 3" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Suzan Wexler (who also did the art direction to "Spider-Man 3" & the upcoming "The Soloist" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent! The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to "Zathura" & the upcoming "Land Of The Lost" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to "Elf", "Zathura", & "Made") is excellent! This is an action-adventure comic-book movie that works on all cylinders. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark / Iron Man. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year. This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.

review/summary: Downey is TERRIFIC! But there is something missing...
review/text: Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.

review/summary: "Is this the last act of defiance from Tony Stark?"
review/text: Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force. I don't quite know if this is the best superhero film ever made, but IRON MAN's just about got me convinced that it at least ranks right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the first two SUPERMAN movies, with Christopher Reeve (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman - The Movie</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJ79V6">Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Everything seems to have fallen into place for IRON MAN, from the knocked-out-of-the-park special effects to the well-written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast. It's just a good story told very well. And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.  Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has got it all, riches and notoriety and an off-the-charts genius I.Q. A debonair gazillionaire who inherited Starks Industries, Stark has been content breezing thru his days as a freewheeling playboy/inventor. Swanky pad in Malibu. Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers. When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."  But his worldview is forever altered when he goes to the Middle East for a weapons presentation. Terrorists blow up his vehicle, the resulting explosion causing shrapnel to be imbedded in his chest, very close to his heart. A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart. The terrorists, who hail Tony as the most famous mass murderer in America, insist that he build missiles for them. Accordingly, Tony is kept in a cave and given access to scrap metal and missile parts. But, Tony Stark, with nothing left to lose, decides to build something else...  This film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream. IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods. There are so many highlight, pump-you-up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for. The first appearance of the clunky Iron Man armor. The first time he takes flight. Tony's step-by-step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model. The first time the new model goes into action. And much, much more. Let me just say, eyeing schematics have never been so much fun. It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor. His underground lab is an eye-popping marvel of hi-tech gadgetry, which includes an artificial intelligence named Jarvis (in the comics, Jarvis is an all-too human butler of Tony's and the Avengers'). And when Iron Man finally truimphantly blazes thru the skies in ridiculous velocities - well, whew! No complaints at all, at all with how the Iron Man armors are imagined on screen. Prepare to get blown away.  IRON MAN is peopled by stock characters, no lie. The faithful, beautiful long-suffering, long-in-love assistant. The backstabbing business partner. The terrorists. Even the hero of the film isn't cut from a new cloth (uncaring industrialist undergoing a moral 180). But here's the thing: when these cliches are played by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Robert Downey, Jr., well, then, the cardboard suddenly gains layers of depth.  Iron Man had always been so far down my list of favorite superheroes, it's kind of pathetic. Before this film, I've never found him that interesting in the comic books. Too cold, too smug, too superior, too powerful...Plus, if you've been following the recent Civil War crossover event in the Marvel comics, Iron Man, in my eyes, played a very distasteful role. But Iron Man on screen is something else. On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool! But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes this flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role. And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think "Yes, of course!" - the man fits the part so seamlessly. Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now. Downey's done stuff and lived life outrageously, good and bad. And, really, that's Tony Stark to a T. Even more than Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex-weaponeer who's literally had a change of heart, redemption comes in rip-roaring heavy metal...

review/text: This is almost a perfect super hero film.  It looks beautiful on Blu-ray and sounds incredible.  In only a few moments the movie gets rolling and never lets up.  Mixing action with a pretty good storyline to get any non-comics reader up to snuff on Iron Man history, this movie really does a good job.  Not overly gory and mild language make this movie okay for teenagers.  One quick sex scene without any nudity does make this a parental decision for anyone with younger kids.  After Fantastic Four I was really surprised by the quality of this film.

review/summary: I'm sorry. This is the fun-vee. The hum-drum-vee is back there. [ Don't wait up for me, honey.]
review/text: One of the most recent in the Marvel Comic-book to screen translations of classic superheros, this time it's Iron Man about Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.); the young, egotistical heir to Stark Industries (weapon creators and manufactuers).  On a routine trip in the middle east Tony gets taken prisoner and is demanded to build his newest weapon, the jericho, for these criminals. With a little help Tony plots his only way of escape, an iron suit.  When Tony finally returns home he is a changed man, destined to return to seek his revenge on the men that held him captive, and of course  get his weapons back from the wrong hands.  Similar to Batman Begins, Iron Man is more focused on the acts of Tony becomming the Iron Man, then infact jumping completely into an action packed adventure, amazingly it's thurough enough to get the full story yet the pace never draws too slow.  Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Mr. Tony Stark, he carries that perfect overconfident yet always believable attitude .  One of the best superhero movies yet.

review/text: I purchased this Blu-Ray movie from BB. I was worried about the "loading" issues many people have talked about on Amazon as well as other forums. Well I found out that only the initial shipment of Iron Man Blu-Ray suffered from problems loading. The disc attempts to connect online via the PS3 and download content from a server onto your players hard-drive. People were having issues because (1) the servers were over-loaded and (2) the initial batch of discs would attempt to download content without asking for permission first.  The discs have all been replaced and now upon insertion, you will be asked if you want to connect online and download content. I selected "YES" and 1.5 minutes later, I was in the menu ready to watch the movie.  The movie is fantastic and well worth the purchase! Robert D Jr. gives a perfect performance and the special effects will blow your mind.  Don't worry about anything and pick it up! You'll love it!

review/summary: "Keep The Skies Clear" ~ Fighting For Peace One Cheeseburger At A Time
review/text: Well, I guess I'm going to jump on the `Iron Man' bandwagon and admit that I loved the film from beginning to end. Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi-millionaire playboy who sees the error of his way and decides to do all he can to undo the damage wrought upon the world by his destructive creations. His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. I also enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-time executive assistant and future love interest. The chemistry between the two was palpable and believable.  Yes, `Iron Man' receives high marks across the board; strong storyline, wonderful performances, crisp and witty dialogue along with a heart-pounding soundtrack that will leave you anxiously awaiting the sequel. A number of previous reviews have made the statement that the special effects don't live up to expectations. I'm not an effects expert, but it sure looked awfully spectacular to me! My Rating: -5 Stars-.

review/summary: Iron Man rocks! A great summer movie even for Iron Man novices
review/text: I'm not a comic book fan at all. So I know about Spiderman, Superman and Batman, but I know nothing of some of the "minor" superheroes that end up starring in big budget motion pictures. I know nothing about Iron Man's origin, the villians, and all of the backstory that go into the universe he lives in. Is the movie, IRON MAN, a movie I could enjoy when I don't know about or really care about Iron Man? The answer is YES. Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie. The critics got this one right. This really is a good movie.  The strength of the movie starts with the cast. You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer. Stark is a womanizing playboy who has every gadget imaginable, but few if any true friends. Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is his harried assistant who perhaps harbors long buried feelings for Stark. Jeff Bridges is okay as Obidiah Stane, Stark's partner who has big things in mind for Stark Industries. Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard. It is pretty funny. The rest of the cast is stellar.  The plot seems to be standard superhero stuff. I was worried that the movie might try and make a politcal statement about war. After all, the plot involves a gigantic weapons manufacturer and Islamic terrorists. The movie wades through these waters with ease, giving it realism while never offending any one's political beliefs.  The movie has some violence that could be too harsh for younger children. There is some adult situations but no bad language. The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible. This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.

review/summary: 4 ½ Stars: Your Friendly Neighborhood "IRON MAN"...OOPS! Wrong Super-Hero!
review/text: The next anticipated movie from the Marvel line of comic books is "IRON MAN". There has been an overload of comic book films and thankfully, this one doesn`t have "Fantastic Four`s" quality. "Shellhead" goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Yes, the movie is great and as with "Spider-Man" is the cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be. Yes, everything but it didn't quite unseat "Spider-man 2" as Marvel's best comic adaptation. (in my opinion)  Anthony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist/inventor and dubbed as a "Merchant of War"; Stark makes most of his fortune making weapons for the military. One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists. With the aid of a man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark creates a suit of armor from scratch and escapes the clutches of the terrorists. This experience had apparently affected Stark in a life-changing way. Now he intends to use his resources to the betterment of mankind, much to the dismay of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). To atone for his sins, Stark builds a steel-mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine...  When I said that the film is a cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be, it is because the screenplay carries references to the Shellhead's comic series from his very origin. Never try to "fix" something that's not broken. The backdrop has been changed from Vietnam to Iraq; and this is a very clever move since it does relate to current events. Characters from the comic make a appearance; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Yinsen, Obadiah Stane (strong references to "Ultimate Iron Man"), Jarvis the robotic assistant (Jarvis the butler was probably avoided due to similarities to Batman's Alfred) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). S.H.I.E.L.D., "War Machine" and the Avengers Initiative anyone? The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited. Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.  All these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie. The direction has near-excellent structure. I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it. This can be a double-edged sword and I'll explain in a minute. I truly commend the first act of the film as Stark is portrayed as a man very much in for himself who realizes the consequences of his inventions. Why is it so much easier to invent weapons of destruction than to make things to advance mankind? The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity. We're fallible, but what matters is how we make our following choices.  The film is also blessed with a great cast. Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well. Gwyneth Paltrow's "Pepper Potts" may seem a little "doopie" but I rather thought that it was her character in the comic. Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades. Hopefully, the cast is signed for its sequel. The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory. The battle with "Iron Monger" is a little short and not exactly as bone-crushing as I would've preferred it to be but I suppose it fits the film's pace. Boy, the CGI can trample the EFX in "Tranformers". Shellhead is a "global" super-hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.  Now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that "Iron Man" is a great movie. Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue. But the film seemed too `safe" and while the script was very good, it just didn't feel that it was willing to take risks and somehow, I think it didn't realize its full potential. The villain is a little underwhelming and as to be expected, the hero will encounter his exact opposite, that ends up being predictable. Just who is Obadiah Stane in the comic book? He is the man who trampled Stark to the ground and drove him to alcoholism. The man should be cunning and evil, not reduced to a power hungry, greedy businessman.  As great as the movie is, it just didn't offer any surprises and I felt like I was just watching just another "super-hero" movie and I`m ready for the next one. Maybe if this came before the first "Spider-man" (that launched the super-hero new wave) then this film would be just awe-inspiring. The film just put me in very familiar territory that I really felt as if it was the same old thing. Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining. Are these signs of super-hero overdose?  Despite the feeling of "super-hero" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too "safe" for its own good, I really believe "Iron Man" is still a great effort in the super hero genre. At least, it knew what it wanted to do; entertain the young and old alike. The film is not pretentious and despite the limits it imposed on itself, the film is a very entertaining and a great summer film. Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super-hero flicks to grace movie theaters.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 ½ stars] This review was drafted in June 2008.

review/summary: The golden avenger scores in his first film.
review/text: Marvel kicked off the current age of superhero films with 1998's "Blade" and 2000's "X-Men", and the vast majority of the films made have been based on their properties, but it has not been especially lucrative for Marvel Comics itself until "Iron Man", when they went into business for themselves and began making their own films.  "Iron Man" is the debut, and it's a huge success both financially and critically; combined with the not-as-good but watchable "The Incredible Hulk" and the future looks bright for Marvel Studios.  Tony Stark, aka Iron Man is a member of a select club of superheroes that includes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man: heroes who have been consistently published in their own book since their creation. In Tony's case, this is his 46th year of continuous publication through four different volumes. Not bad, really; the character has usually occupied a middle-to-low position on the sales charts, but consistency outstrips flashes in the pan.  His past history in other media includes a number of animated series (most famously the 60s cartoon of which the most memorable thing was the enjoyably cheesy theme tune), but this is the character's first film adventure.  Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film:  billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., phenomenal) is a famous playboy (think Bruce Wayne if Wayne was actually enjoying himself) who is caught by the enemy in wartime Afghanistan (the modern version of his origin detailed by Warren Ellis, updated from the original Vietnam), and builds a suit of powered armour to escape captivity.  He arrives home a changed man, vowing to take on the military-industrial complex at home while protecting the innocent abroad.  This doesn't go over especially well with his board of directors, including his father's old partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, bald).  Meanwhile, Tony's girl friday, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow, returning to the screen after an absence of a few years), and his best friend General James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) worry about what he's up to.  The film is a hodgepodge of different areas of the comics, distilled: the basic origin and Pepper Potts' presence are from the original Stan Lee/Don Heck era, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on "Armour Wars".  Obadiah Stane, repurposed from the O'Neill era, is the main villain.  As earlier stated, it's a basic origin film, but it's the execution and the details that elevate it to the level of excellence.  Downey Jr. is indispensable as Tony Stark, created one of the most likeable characters yet seen in a superhero film; relentlessly charismatic and amusing in a way that strongly recalls Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.  Bridges, as Stane, does a strong job as Tony's corporate foe, although he isn't an especially big part of the story; indeed, probably the best stuff in the movie are the scenes when it is just Downey Jr. and some robotic props developing the armour.  There's a spectacular setpiece battle when Iron Man first takes the fight to terrorists in Afghanistan, and later returns to rescue a village, concluding with a dogfight with the US Air Force. Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough.  The film is peppered with setup for future Marvel projects: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ol' Nick himself, talking about his "Avenger Initiative"), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the "Ten Rings" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing "next time, baby" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Iron Man Strike Box Office GOLD!!!!!
review/text: This is one of the best comic to film adaptations produced based upon a literate script, terrific performances, solid direction, and special effects that aren't over-the-top!  I don't want to take this kind of entertainment too seriously, so I will not go with the long summary of the plot and simply give a quick recap of it and what I liked best and least about this totally fun-filled film.  Robert Downey, Jr. is NOT the kind of person anyone would expect to play a superhero and that is precisely why this film works so well in casting him as one as his character is the total opposite of a superhero at first.  Downey, as Tony Stark, is a self-absorbed jerk who lives for fast women, fast cars and fast money while profiteering off of war.  He is the living example of why we don't want unmanned aircraft bombers.  We want the human element.  We don't want war to be reduced to a video game and have lives reduced to a blimp on a screen, but this is how Stark lives when we first meet him.  He creates weapons of mass destruction without ever understanding or caring about his weapons' impact on the world, let alone who ends up with them.  It's the all mighty dollar hidden under the cloak of patriotism.  This all changes when Stark is kidnapped in Afghanistan and sees how his weapons are falling into enemy hands and how the lives of innocent people are affected by his "toys."  Once he escapes, he slowly becomes a new man, in more ways than one and it's nice that he's a hero by choice and not some experiment gone.  Stark is assisted by a number of people from his glorified secretary well-played by Gwenyth Paltrow to his military connection nicely acted by Terrence Howard.  Of course, it is no secret at this point, and very highly predictable anyhow, that his family's best friend and second in command at his company is out to circumvent Stark's efforts to stop bloodshed.  Jeff Bridges hams it up some in this role, but he's convincing and fun as the eventual villain.  The Misses:   This material, as entertaining as it is, is beneath Paltrow who is a very serious actress and should be doing things far worthier of her talents.   The plot element of the family friend running the business for personal gain is far too reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins</a>.  The Hits:  There are only two significant "misses" with this film and, to be honest, they aren't all that significant (just enough for me to note them)   The casting is perfect and inspired.  While I believe that Paltrow is better than this kind of film, she gives a very spirited performance.  Downey is just down right perfect for the this flawed hero and Bridges is just plain fun in his juicy role.   The special effects DO NOT take over this film, as they did in the equally fun, but over-the-top <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a>.   The direction is confident and unobtrusive which I can't say for a film such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C">Spider-Man 3</a> which was directed well enough, but Sam Rami just tried a little too hard to put his stamp so-to-speak on it.   This film is entertaining, but not in the kind of mindless way that other superhero films have been.  This film has some heart and soul.   I can't say enough about the literate script for this film.  It can be funny one moment and cerebral the next.  That is tough to do in this comic book adaptation genre.  It usually goes too much one way in seriousness as with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5W6">Hulk</a> or too slapstick silly as with too many moments in Spider-Man 3.  This film finds a comfortable balance between serious and humorous.  This is an outstanding film and I look forward to the two sequels that are currently planned for this new comic book hero to make it to the silver screen.

review/summary: The word "awesome" get thrown around a lot...
review/text: ...particularly by me.  But this is one film that actually manages to live up to everything one might expect from all that that word entails.  This is quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever. At times it leaves you nearly breathless, leaving you just enough to whisper "bada$z" in awe of what you just witnessed (a friend of mine actually did this).  The CG effects are wholly indistinguishable from the practical ones, the action comes in somewhat small but memorable doses, and most importantly the story takes it's time developing it's characters and their unique relationships.  And that is where "Iron Man" hits it's home run: characters you thoroughly enjoy watching that make the action sequences and special effects just icing on the cake.  The movie does not waste time getting you into the good stuff.  The opening sequence does a great job of summing up the audaciousness, charm, and humor of weapons dealer/genius inventor/billionaire Tony Stark just before his caravan is attacked.  The last thing he sees as he dives for cover from the terrorists before blacking out?  An explosive with his company's name on it that sends shrapnel into his chest, setting the story in motion.  Beautiful.  Flashback to some days back and we get a better picture of our hero to be.  And let me tell you, it is good to be Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. is everything you'd hope, bringing the kind of bombastic personality that just can't be portrayed in a comic book to the big screen. The supporting cast is also strong. Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant as Pepper Potts; snippy sometimes, cool and collected most times, and coy and awkward in potentially romantic situations.  Also worthy of note is Jeff Bridges' convincing performance as Stark's business partner Obediah.  The biggest change from the source material (and there are many) was replacing Jarvis the butler with a HERBIE-style (from the FF, not the Love Bug) talking computer.  But with the faithful butler having been done to death in the many Batman films, this change makes a lot of sense.  Also, Stan Lee's cameo is likely to cause outright guffaws, so be careful you don't spray your drink on the people in front of you.  As usual, this Marvel superhero flick is peppered with references for comic geeks, lots of character-based humor, and moral arguments and choices.  Setting much of this story in the Middle East highlights the relevance of the story's message of accountability for our actions and our creations (I'm looking at YOU, America!) without being overtly political.  Tony Stark's realization that his works have brought death and destruction to so many and the subsequent hostile takeover attempt on Stark Industries when he attempts to do the right thing make for a great motivation to put on the armor and attempt to undo some of the damage that has been done in his name.  Good stuff.  And while it's no suprise that "Iron Man" has plenty of heavy metal in it's soundtrack, I wasn't expecting to hear Mister Stark admonish Miss Potts for turning down his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000007489">Suicidal Tendencies</a> jam.  Now THERE'S a superhero I can relate to. So cool.  I find sitting through 10 minutes of credits intolerable, so I left the theater before they had finished rolling and apparently missed a scene that I had been hoping for.  Now I regret it.  Don't make the same mistake. That's what I get for not reading any reviews ahead of time (spoilers and all that).  Either way, this is not a film to be missed if you're a fan of superhero flicks, comic books, science fiction, or just entertaining cinema.  This is a film firing on all cylinders and is sure to please all but the most jaded of fans.  It's about time that the Golden Avenger got his big-screen due, but it was worth the wait to see it dome so superbly.  There is a moment where Tony's military buddy James Rhodes watches him fly out of his lab to save the day then looks to the side to see a chrome suit (the War Machine, I presume) and says to himself/us "next time, baby".  I wouldn't miss it for the world.

review/summary: "Iron Man" is an Instant Classic
review/text: Now this is how to make a summer movie.  "Iron Man" explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.  Robert Downey, Jr., a gifted actor long haunted by demons manifested as substance abuse, powers this new-fangled classic as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, infusing the splashy playboy with bone-dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.  At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self-designed weapons while staying half a world away from the harsh consequences of their use.  And why should he care in the first place?  He's far too busy showing off his high-powered toys of mass destruction; that and bedding every beautiful woman he sees, much to the consternation of his best friend and military liaison Colonel Rhodes (Terrance Howard, every bit as stellar here as Downey, Jr.) and his loyal secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.  The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant; kudos to director Jon Favreau and his large team of screenwriters, which includes the scribes for Children of Men, for knowing it's the little things like depth of character that really count.  But Stark gets jolted to reality when his military convoy is attacked on a rural Afghani road by warlords who seek to use Stark's technical acumen for their own arsenals.  To add insult to injury, the convoy is attacked with Stark's own weapons, which the extremists have procured through black market sales and illegal arms deals.  Struck in a dank, suffocating cave, Stark first realizes the true gravity of making cavalier billions off of weapons of war.  Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.  With it, he will flee and use it to destroy all the loose arms that are linked to him.  Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.  Back in America, Stark keeps himself in seclusion, perfecting a new battlesuit that will allow him to undo the wrong he has inadvertently committed, but not before trying to get his company, inherited from his gung-ho father, to discontinue weapons development.  However, his second in command, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, a blazing villain), will have none of it.  To him, there's too much green in selling high caliber goods; peace politics are for those too weak to take power and wealth.  So its Stark and his reformed sense of responsibility versus high-rolling capitalism run amok, and their final battle, with two iron-suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.  But the true joy of Iron Man is not its action or seamless special effects.  It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.  Folks, this is how it's supposed to be done.

review/summary: The Man in the Iron Mask...
review/text: 2008's "Iron Man" is a very clever screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero.  Robert Downey Jr. is a surprisingly good Tony Starks, billionaire weapons inventor, who rediscovers his humanity while a prisoner of terrorists.  Gwenyth Paltrow is his beautiful and very capable personal assistant Pepper Potts, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a nicely dark role as his corporate deputy.  Terrance Howard is Starks' strait-laced military liaison.  As the story opens, Starks is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapon.  His convoy is ambushed, and the wounded Starks wakes up in a cave, a survivor of unorthodox heart surgery by another hostage. His captors demand that he build them a superweapon.  Starks instead builds an iron suit that will allow him to escape.  The jury-rigged suit lasts just long enough to get out of his captors' clutches, but the experience leaves him a changed man.  Upon his return, Starks tells his deputy, and the press, that he will take Stark Industries out of the weapons business, then locks himself in his lab to build a better iron suit.  In an inpromptu visit to a charity event, Starks discovers that he has lost control of the company and that his weapons are being sold indiscriminately around the world.  Starks takes on his Iron Man personna to set things right, not realizing how ruthless his real enemies are.  In a climactic fight scene, Iron Man faces off with an unexpected foe in a copy of his own super suit.  The Afghanistan sequences are tightly paced and suspenseful.  The leisurely intermediate scenes, as Starks perfects his Iron Man suit, feature high tech and high humor.  The suspense is back on for the finale, with an ending that begs for sequels.  Downey is entirely convincing as the very human man inside an iron mask.  Paltrow isn't given a lot to do, and her budding romance with Starks gets little screen time.  The Iron Man franchise has been nicely updated.  The movie might have benefited from tighter editing; it does just avoid overwhelming the story with CGI effects.  "Iron Man" is highly recommended to viewers looking for an entertaining action movie.

review/summary: Pretty good flick; great special effects
review/text: This is a pretty good adaptation of the famous Marvel comic book character.  Hollywood couldn't resist having the film push a pacifist political message (Tony Stark abandons making weapons, etc.) but overall the plot moves along pretty good.  The special effects are really good.  Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, Tony Stark's girl Friday; she is absolutely spectacular.  She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.  Robert Downey Jr. was really not my idea of Tony Stark, but he carries the role off pretty well, and gives us lots of laughs.  This is the best adaptation of a comic book superhero to the screen since Spider-Man.  Well worth seeing.  RJB.

review/summary: Fairly good..
review/text: The graphics are top notch. The animators even show off a bit at times, which is acceptable i suppose. The story is a little iffy though.  Basically tony stark gets kidnapped, makes iron suit, escapes, jealous coworker steals his idea.  The good part of it are, the story is actually entertaining, it has flynn from tron, great cg graphics.  the bad, it milks the arabian terrorist routine to make stark look more like a hero. to me that is a little insensitive to the people who actually lost people in iraq/afghanistan  blah blah blah, and people who are arabian. granted it doesnt depict all arabians like that. but i'm not sensitive, but i can just guess the convoy scene might make a few widows burst into tears.  robert downy jr. does a very good job playing annoying people. only seen 2 movies with him (natural born killers and this). he seems like a nice guy, and pulls off being ironman fairly well. even makes his character appear to mature during the picture.  my overall verdict is, its definitely worth buying. it is has a decent amount of tragedy, comedy and action. its not the best of all movies, but does not fall into the mediocre to sucky movie range.

review/summary: Jeff Bridges is an excellent villain
review/text: Iron Man is one of the more successful Marvel adaptations and Robert Downey Jr captures the carefree Tony Stark very well. When he realizes that his company is supplying terrorists after his capture and the selfless help of his fellow prisoner who allows him to escape at the cost of his own life, Stark is a changed man. His literal heart has some problems, which reflects the virtual heart that he develops during the course of the movie. He is affected deeply and begins trying to use his vast fortune to try to alter the direction of his company. However, Jeff Bridges' character is totally vested in the system and sets out to prevent a change in the power structure and eventually transforms from being mentor to foe. He fully inhabits this character and those familiar with his work will find him at first nearly unrecognizable, yet his acting talent is displayed to excellent effect. He makes a surprisingly good villain, supplying the "badness" all heroes need as a foil to their "goodness." The ending news conference is somewhat surprising, but on reflection, totally in character for the reckless Iron Man.

review/summary: Iron Man Will Rock Your Socks Off
review/text: Iron Man is witty, well-paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.  I must admit, I was only dimly aware of the existence of Iron Man before this movie was released. Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.  The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.  The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition. Either way, you might as well take your socks off before you press 'play'. Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Very Entertaining, & Looks Good On Blu-Ray
review/text: Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.  Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a "kids" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent "Transformers" film I viewed.  The scenes with "Iron Man" a.k.a. "Tony Stark" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy "Obadiah Stane" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.  Some complain the film is not really all that "smart" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters.  And.....it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.

review/summary: Great Action Movie!
review/text: I have no idea who IronMan is, I never read comics and do NOT have any extended reviews of this movie.  I can say however that I just saw it last night on my big screen downstairs and absolutely loved it.  The basic story line is a weapons developer, Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr is captured by enemies using his weapons to cause destruction and chaos through terrorism. During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.  Overall it did not seem as long as it was, and was extremely entertaining.  Downey does an excellent job keeping us entertained and most importantly keeping my attention.  A great movie for your library if its something you are into keeping.

There aren't any "stoopid" female roles (e.g., the women don't end up falling [as they run away from an evil man], getting caught, or becoming hostages that force Iron Man to make those humanity-vs-love-interest choices); instead, the main female character is smart, funny, and savvy.  Refreshing.  There's a few plot surprises, too.  This is a smartly made/directed, fun, and entertaining action movie.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Iron Man, see it on the big screen if possible!
review/text: There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film. To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read.  Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.  At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!) I for one look forward to IM 2, but I'm less anticipatory of the Avengers...I mean look at the X-Men franchise!

review/summary: Not bad...not bad!
review/text: Though I'm sure I would have NEVER picked Robert Downey Jr. for the lead, this movie worked! It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated "Daredevil",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)  Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both "Hulk" movies and the first two "Spiderman" flicks being cases in point.)  Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, ("Sky Captain",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since "The Big Lebowski"...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.  I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...? It really doesn't do anything wrong, and really, isn't that what we most want from a movie...?

review/summary: Robocop Jr.
review/text: I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.  My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.  On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer.  Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.  The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes.  Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie.  Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.  Author of Gotta Be Down!

review/summary: It does work on PS3.
review/text: If you own a PS3 just wait a few minutes and disc 1 will start playing.  The special features are very cool.  I always love seeing behind-the-scenes special FX work.  As for the movie, it's probably the best superhero movie ever.  IMO, only Batman Begins rivals it.  I guess rich billionaire playboys just make better superheros.  This movie isn't very violent, so I don't think parents should worry too much.  There are maybe one or two scenes that are sexually suggestive, but nothing worse than you might find on network TV.  It is easily my favorite movie of '08 and I can't wait for the sequel.  Remember to wait 'til the end of the credits for a surprise!

review/summary: Heavy Metal
review/text: It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.  By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.  Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly naïve and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.  At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.  There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around "repulsor lift" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?  Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more.  And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!

review/summary: Easily the best of all Marvel movies so far
review/text: I was really excited at the prospect of an Iron Man movie, but worried it'd be overloaded with SFX or that the character wouldn't work. I raised an eyebrow when I heard Robert Downey was playing Tony Stark, but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Last time I did that, it was when Michael Keaton was cast in the first Batman movie.  In both cases, my doubts were groundless. This movie is, in a word, superb. Usually I won't say that, especially about a modern SF film. This time, they got it absolutely right. The pacing is perfect, the characters are actually developed well, the story is well adapted to the 40+ year Iron Man mythos, and the SFX are used to support the story. Usually it's the other way around, with the effects totally overwhelming the rest of the film in order to please fanboy types and kids who just want eye candy.  While the film is generally very serious, there are nice touches of both humor and romance. The supporting characters and actors -- and I mean ALL of them -- are excellent. Downey's characterization of Stark, and the gravitas he brings to the character once he realizes what his company has been doing with its weapons, is absolutely spot on. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Obadiah -- as callous a villain as ever walked the earth.  Many film companies still seem to think all you need in any science fiction film are blinking lights, big explosions, and female characters in tight spandex. That's what Gene Roddenberry ran into when he tried to make the original Star Trek; the producers literally told him to stick in some blinking lights and start filming. Way too many SF films and TV series have fallen into that same trap.  If this movie doesn't get film industry executives to re-think that position, they shouldn't be making movies. Then again, Peter Jackson's LoTR films have already proved SF films can be Oscar material.  We need more movies like this. I can't wait for the 2nd installment.

review/text: I have to concur with others, Robert Downey Jr as a superhero?  Yet it does work and he gives a terrific performance.  Now that Marvel has it's fate in it's own hands, we should see some positive results and nothing as bad as Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher and the Fantastic Four!  IRON MAN is the first of their own films and their plans are ambitious to say the least.  No film in 2009 but 2010 will have IRON MAN 2 and THOR. 2011 will have CAPTAIN AMERICA and THE AVENGERS.  It will be interesting to see if the latter beats JLA to the big screen.

review/summary: Proper superhero action
review/text: I am a big Marvel Comics fan, always have been, but I shall be amongst the first to throw stones at Marvel and Hollywood for the way they've treated so many of me childhood heroes on the silver screen. "Spiderman" was fine, but all the rest of the lot were... well, less than good.  Then comes "Iron Man". I was expecting "Fantastic Dare-Hulk 7" but what I got was something different entirely. It was really good.  "Iron Man" is well casted, well played, and indeed, well made. The action sequences doesn't steal the picture absolutely, as have been the case with earlier superhero films; nor does the film lack character development. The humour works, for a change, and although this film absolutely is sci-fi d'or, it somehow doesn't seem that far fetched. It is made believable, or at least acceptable.  Some critics will probably say it is not fast paced enough, but not I. I think they made it just right with this one, and I'm genuinely looking forward to the next installment (if one is on the way, of course).  Highly recommendable.

review/summary: Not sturdy as steel, but certainly shiny as iron
review/text: Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's "Iron Man" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series and Bryan Singer's "X-Men" films, "Iron Man" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.  Like its protagonist, "Iron Man" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike "Batman Begins" (the sequel to which, July's "The Dark Knight," stands as "Iron Man"'s fiercest competition), "Iron Man" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike "Batman Begins."  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, "Elf" and "Zathura," but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.  But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in "The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.  Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.  The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as "The Dude" from the Coen brothers' "The Big Lebowski," isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns."  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.  Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer").  Not in "Iron Man."  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's "Transformers."  All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in "Daredevil" or the last "X-Men" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.  "Iron Man" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for "Iron Man 2" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  "Iron Man" may not be an excellent film like "Spider-Man 2," "Batman Begins," or even the original "Superman," but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron.

review/summary: Stay until the end of the credits
review/text: After being captured in Afghanistan and forced, against his will, to build a particularly nasty type of missile for the enemy, billionaire inventor and weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) instead builds himself a super-suit and escapes. Upon returning to the United States, Stark improves on his super-suit and then sets about trying to correct all of the damage he has done through the sales of weapons.  I did not expect to like "Iron Man". I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second-rate and the endings are irritatingly open-ended. The only reason why I went to see "Iron Man" at all was because my father wanted to see it and I just went along to keep him company. I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.  I have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for "Chaplin") and his performance in "Iron Man" is no exception. Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain. Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).  The film's script is filled with the sort of light-hearted bantering that is typical of a Robert Downey Jr. film but also has a point to make about the culpability of weapons manufacturers. I particularly liked the fact that this film was set in the real world, rather than in a universe that exists almost parallel to our reality, like "Batman" or "Superman". My main criticism of this film is that it is just so predictable. Some of the plot twists I could see coming for almost an hour before they eventuated.  Overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money. "Iron Man" is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as "Spiderman" or "X-Men", but it still should appeal to viewers of all ages. And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits. Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.

review/summary: Downey Triumphant as the Invincible IRON MAN
review/text: Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.  Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.  Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.  Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.  The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.  It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.  There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.  In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.  I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!

review/summary: Saving the World One Weapon at a Time
review/text: If Superman has Lex Luthor and Spider-Man has Dr. Octopus and Batman has the Joker, who exactly is Iron Man's archenemy? He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself. In Jon Favreau's "Iron Man," billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) eventually realizes that the ultra high tech weapons he designed have done much more harm than good, so in a way, the climactic fight scene at the end was his own doing. What a perfect display of irony, especially for a superhero trying to free himself of his infamous reputation as a war-mongering mass murderer. Where exactly is the line drawn? At what point can weapons of mass destruction ever be considered a path to peace?  You don't normally associate moral dilemmas of this magnitude with a comic book adaptation. The thing is, the idea of a suited man fighting against an adversary plotting to take over the world is not lost in "Iron Man"--it just takes on a much different form. In this case the adversaries are war and injustice, both of which shake their threatening fists at the world every hour of every day. What is lost in "Iron Man" is the idea that a superhero has to be a perfect, emotionless drone that tirelessly fights for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Even with his money, his brilliance, and his specially designed suit, Stark is about as flawed as the average Joe walking down the street. He's stubborn, cocky, just a smidge arrogant, and after being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, he's far too willing place himself in scenarios he may not be ready for.  Before being held captive, Stark was a smooth-talking businessman that designed the most advanced weapons the American military has ever seen. While in Afghanistan introducing a new missile-launcher called the Jericho, he's attacked and kidnapped by a militant group of Afghani extremists. They demand that he manufacture the Jericho for them, and since they somehow have gained access to many of his weapons, this shouldn't be too difficult. But even with a metal device implanted in his chest (supposedly to keep the shrapnel in his body from reaching his heart), he refuses to be under their control; with the help of an Afghani scientist (Shaun Toub), Stark secretly builds a prototype metal suit that can throw flames and shoot bullets and protect him from enemy fire. An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.  Stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. His colleague--Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges)--doesn't go along with this for reasons that are expected in comic book adaptations, such as being power-hungry. This doesn't stop Stark, who begins redesigning his metal suit in the comfort of his luxurious, technologically advanced Malibu estate. After installing a few upgrades, like rocket boosters and missile launchers, he tests his new red and gold suit by flying back to Afghanistan and attacking the same militant group that kidnapped him. How convenient that he happens to arrive just as they're raiding a village and taking civilians captive; superheroes save the day strictly because of convenient plot devices, and that's one of the reasons why we like these movies so much.  With the help of his personal assistant, the anxious but highly capable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his friend, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark spends the rest of the film trying to put an end to his past reputation, first by finding out how the Afghanis received crates of his weapons, second by battling against Stane, who has let his position in the company get the better of him. Yes, it's all enhanced by a wealth of impressive special effects, but that's not the point: Stark is introduced as a man who has everything while at the same time having nothing, and most of this stems from his unwillingness to acknowledge his effect on the world--he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim. Now that he's seen the error of his ways, he wants to redeem himself by fighting against the monster of his own creation. He does this all while maintaining a smug yet charming attitude, which is good because a superhero should be allowed to have a little personality.  Even better than that is not hiding that personality behind an alter ego, one that behaves as an obvious polar opposite to the hero. This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined. It's essentially because of him that "Iron Man" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation. He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for "Iron Man"; at the time, it seemed unlikely that he would be the type to fly alongside jetfighters or to shoot highly explosive missiles at tanks. But it's obvious now--he was exactly what was needed to realize the reworked idea of hero versus enemy. A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either.

I did not quite understand what all the hype surrounding this movie was about Robert Downey Jr. was not very convincing as a good guy i liked him better when he was selling weapons and couldn't care less about anyone else, his good side felt to me as somewhat forced on him, didn't believe it. Although i love Gwyneth Paltrow i hated this part for her, it was just meaningless and very secondary, any up and coming actress could have done that role. Paltrow should have never agreed to it. All in all i do not think this movie has what it takes to be on the top ten list of best comic book adaptations.

review/summary: Great movie, comic or no
review/text: Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.  Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's "Pepper Potts." The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.  One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.  -- wiredweird

review/summary: The best film to come from Marvel in quite some time
review/text: Being Marvel Studios' first self-financed film, Iron Man is a pure treat from start to finish.  I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming.

review/summary: Iron Man BD load problem was server related. Great flick!
review/text: Just watched Iron Man Blu-ray edition, and it is fantastic. Disc one had a problem loading yesterday, but it was due to a server problem as the disc tried to access BD live. Paramount corrected the situation, and the disc plays perfect now. If your disc is taking long to load...If you have your PS3 settings set to automatically connect to the internet for BD-Live content, then the 'Iron Man' BD does that first thing. It takes about 5 minutes to download and initialize that feature. Just let the disc load once and it will load quickly everytime afterwards. Or, you can turn off the automatic internet feature under your XMB BD settings.  When I was watching my BD for the first time, I went through the same thing. Anyway, I wonder if the startup time is just different for everyone because of a hit on their servers or something. If they are downloading stuff for BD-Live at the beginning like we are speculating, then maybe a lot of people just getting home from school or off work are trying it now so the downloading is taking a lot longer.  Fantastic reference type Blu-ray. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Wow, He Really IS Iron Man!
review/text: Marvel Comics, like it's counterpart nemesis DC, has had it's share of hits and misses when it comes to translating it's superhero catalog to the big screen. While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.  Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.  Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.  Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.  Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.  P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or more if that was the version I chose to see as of this writing. (RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)

review/summary: An ironclad action romp: a superhero film that's actually a good movie
review/text: "Iron Man" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.  Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...  I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in "The Incredible Hulk.")  Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, "Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.  So go see "Iron Man."  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, "Iron Man" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.

review/summary: I Am Iron Man
review/text: Iron Man is simply one of the best. Forget the sorry excuses for movies that were Spider Man 3, or The Fantastic Four, forget all that nonsense. Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins. What a way to kick off the summer season that will also see long awaited films such as the new Indiana Jones movie, the second Batman film The Dark Night, and the redo of The Incredible Hulk.  The film starts off with billionaire/genius weapons developer Tony Stark riding in the back of a Humvee in the Afghan desert, havening successfully impressed the military by blowing up a whole mountain with his new Jericho Missile. From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen. He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man. One memorable scene was when a girl Toney was with woke up in his house alone and found his personal assistance, Pepper Pots, with her dry-cleaning. "Ten years and he still has you doing his dry cleaning?" "I do anything he requires of me," Potts replies, "even, occasionally, taking out the trash." As he eloquently puts it; "They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, well I respectfully disagree. I prefer the one you only have to fire once. That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far." Now tell me you wouldn't like to hang out with THAT guy.  Unfortunately for our hero the Humvee he's riding comes under fire from Afghan rebels and he is taken hostage and forced to build one of his new weapons for his captures (after refusing of course and getting water boarded). But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.  Far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic. As stated before, Tony Stark is the very definition of cool, but he isn't the only character who steals the show. His lady friend, oddly named Pepper Potts (okay, who was the genius who decided to name her Pepper Potts?) is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm. The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude; plus their conversations with one another are some of the best you'll see in a super hero movie, period.  The only problem I had, and it's a small one, is that the action in this film was a little lacking. The escape from Afghanistan in the first Iran Man was great, and the battle between Iron Man and the Afghan militia later on was also incredible, but when it came to Iron Man VS really big Iron Man, the outcome was somewhat of a disappointment; the reason being that we never got to see both fighting at their best. One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight. To see both go at it at their best would have been nothing short of amazing, unfortunately though we never got to see that.  If you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick. Iron Man stands proud with the best in its genera and simply blows out of the water most badly made adoptions. Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.  Re-watch Value; VERY high.

review/text: Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical.  I watched this movie with the family (not my choice of movie), and it wasn't a total waste of time, but I do wish the time had been better spent.

review/summary: The one that started it all!
review/text: This is the movie that kick started the Marvel Universe Phase One. This is a awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr is the one and only Iron Man. This will be the role he is remembered for. He does a excellent job playing Tony Stark. I had this movie on DVD, but it was on sell at Walmart for 10 dollars on blu ray, so I picked out up along with The Avengers 3D blu ray, and if you haven't seen The Avengers yet be sure to do that, it is a can't miss movie. Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade. I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2. I am not saying IM2 is a bad movie, cause it is not, I just enjoyed seeing how Tony Stark progressed into Iron Man. The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible! I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable. If you haven't seen this yet, make sure you do, you don't want to miss out on this blockbuster, and if you are wondering if you should upgrade, if you can find it for a reasonable price go ahead, you won't be disappointed!

review/text: I was surprised how much I liked this movie. I approached it as a bit of action-adventure-comic book escape. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that. There is some serious thematic material subtly woven in, for example the strength of the original heart. And our expectation about who the bad guys really are gets turned on its head.  I also really loved the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. They smoked in a beautifully understated way. All in all, I found it a very satisfying 2+ hours, me who is pretty much the polar opposite of a 12-year-old boy. (But fear not, there is plenty in the film to satisfy that heart as well. Very endearing, actually.) Two thumbs way up.

review/text: The writers and director of IRON MAN have crafted a fine comic book adaptation, skilfully combining character, action. plot, and humour (the latter is essential in such movies, with many failing as a result of self-reverence). Here the script is sharp and lean, and is confidently delivered by a top-flight cast. The set pieces are well constructed and the special effects are impressive. The story, for the most part, is cohesive and convincing. There's not much to criticise here, except perhaps the ending, which is rather predictable. All in all this is first-class entertainment from start to finish.

The 2 disk edition is good, but I think if your going to picture what your selling--it should be that-and not another sleeve, or a written explanation of why another sleeve was substituted, or telling you that they would send you the sleeve pictured in a separate mailing. In this case they did not. The disks are great, and  I made my own sleeve cover, that depicts the original cover shown on the Amazon page. I probably would think twice about buying a another  DVD from this vendor contracted by Amazon.  This did not happen in my previous order on another DVD, but it was from a different contracted vendor.

They said they'd sent out a replacement DVD first thing the next day.  Now, only four days later, I have the new copy.  It's in perfect condition and the original DVD at a more than reasonable price.

review/summary: splendid screen adaption
review/text: Usually, I'm rather sceptic when it comes to screen adaptions of Marvel comic characters/superheroes, because there have been quite a few disappointing examples. This one, however, makes an amazing picture that has everything a superb movie should have: a good storyline, suspense, action, brilliant actors, advanced technology, great movie scores, etc.  Moreover, there is a sense of excellence to be felt throughout the entire movie that is recognizable in the way super-human qualities are depicted. The idea of man and technology merging to form the perfect enhanced being is a core issue. The underlying theme of continuously confronting one's limits to eventually overcome them combined with the archetype of the superhero is of equal value. In fact, the protagonist presents a perfect embodiment of Iron Man which makes this movie a splendid screen adaption of the comic-book series.

review/summary: Iron Man Ultimate 2 Disc Edition
review/text: I recently picked up this dvd and let me tell you, that the action was pretty good.  I knew that Stane (one of the supporting characters) was going to be a nasty dude from the word go since I have the book of Iron Man's adventures.  If you have yet to see the movie, but read the guide which could probably be found in any bookstore like barnes and noble (I can't believe I just recommended this) go for this flick, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Fun Action Adventure Movie
review/text: Iron Man has a lot of talent behind it and can be very entertaining.  Jon Favreau directs with a verve that doesn't forget people as he keeps the super hero format intact.  Robert Downey plays Iron Man with a great sense of humor and as Tony Stark the weapons magnate who is his alter ego.  The movie begins in Afghanistan and Tony Stark is held hostage and escapes by making a protective suit to ward off deadly weapons.  He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.  Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.  Terrence Howard gets to play the sidekick in a fun way.  Jeff Bridges finally gets a bad guy role.  What fun!

review/text: This is my all time favorite movie, right next to "The Lincoln Lawyer".  It is amazing how technological this movie is; how they combined several different types of advanced technology from the abundant power supply to the jets that make him fly and make it look so realistic and possible.  I also enjoyed the sophisticated voice activated and control machinery and computerized technology of his workshop.  It would be great to see a continuation of this movie like a sequel.

review/summary: One of the best
review/text: Easily the best movie based on a Marvel character. Not only does it take the idea of a superhero into new territory, but it also manages to throw in everything lovable about the new found genre. Most of this movie's heart and charm is owed to Robert Downey Jr., who completely ownes the character in every way possible. The reason Iron Man has become a household name so suddenly is because it was acted so well and made as realistic as possible. It also takes the best parts of the source material and makes it into something familiar, but also new (much like Batman Begins). John Favreau managed to get down the comedy without making the movie become one. When this wants to be, it is a fantastic action movie with lots of great explosions and special effects. However, this also knows how to invest time in its characters and plot so we care about what will happen. The attention to detail is incredible.

review/text: Of course by now, everyone knows what a fantastic movie Iron Man is.  It's even more enjoyable on blu-ray where every scene jumps out at you.  I only wish the 5.1 would have sounded a little crisper on my home theatre system, but it's a small thing to comment about.  To me, it's still the best Marvel movie and I loved Thor and X-Men First Class.  Something unique about Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal - he is Tony Stark.

review/summary: Fun and funny
review/text: Robert Downey is quickly impressing me that he may be the most versatile actor of the past few years. When you compare this role with Sherlock Holmes and his performance in Tropic Thunder, you'll understand what I mean if you didn't immediately. All three roles are very different, yet he delivered them expertly, and with a combination of real drama and real humor in each of the three.  In "Iron Man", he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance. Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill. The first Spiderman movie was revolutionary, but the next two were nothing more than continuations of the first. The first Hulk movie was wretched, and even tho the second was an improvement, Edward Norton didn't bring the personality to the character that Bill Bixby did in the TV series. The Fantastic Four was interesting but quickly forgotten The X-Men series was a cut above, and so was Iron Man.  However, without Downey's performance Iron Man might have tanked as badly as the first Hulk. The story is nothing very surprising, and the "surprise" and ending are nothing but predictable. However, Downey's Tony Stark is alive. When he feels we feel. When he seduces a reporter, its all very natural and predatory. When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes. He is charming, infuriating, and at times completely blind to what is going on around him. All very human.  I hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination. Downey's performance almost hides that flaw ... almost.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good Entertainment
review/text: I'll be brief... First of all, I loved IRON MAN as a kid in the comic books. He has no special powers, just a really rockin' suit that kicks everyone else's butts. I never expect a superhero movie to be true to the comic... it's just not possible, but what I do expect is a quality product, a good story line, decent character development, and an ending that makes me want a sequel. This movie delivers all of those things. We see how the character of Tony Stark changes when he undergoes a traumatic event, loses the life of a friend, and has to engage with the betrayal of another friend. In all of this he grows as a person... and yet we see him struggle with how this affects his own personality. All of the while there are enough explosions, actions sequences, and high speed drama to keep me interested. I would give it 5 stars, but there were a few scenes that did drag for me. I recommend watching this movie. If you watch it with your children, be present to answer questions about violence and the difference between good and bad. Have fun.

review/summary: A MARVELous Marvel Masterpiece!
review/text: Iron Man is a rockin', sockin' fan-freakin-tastic superhero film that by far outshines darn near every other superhero fantasy film release thus far. Almost. While Iron Man may be an amazing film, it's worlds apart tonally from DC's The Dark Knight, an equally amazing film. Iron Man is flashy, witty and adventurous, whereas The Dark Knight is darker, grittier, and far more mature. Superhero fantasy film fans are really going to be split down the middle on this; I've come across quite a few people that claim Iron Man is the best comic book flick ever made while others insist The Dark Knight was an instant cinematic masterpiece with more substance. That's going to be up to all of you.  Concerning acting, brilliant stuff, every single actor came strong and delivered their dialogue superbly! I think the only performance I wasn't thrilled with was Terrence Howard's; he just didn't pop for me, I'm almost glad to see him leave the sequel. He's a capable actor but I'm confident Don Cheadle will give Rhodes a new dimension and, hopefully, his alter-ego War Machine as well. Speaking of War Machine, the suit cameo looked awesome; you just know it's going to be pimped to the hilt in the next installment.  This movie's CG was mesmerizing and production design was breathtaking, this is everything a good comic book fantasy film should be. It ups the ante on every single front, especially the phenomenal dialogue. Favreau is without a doubt a capable director and this film in his hands was masterful. I've watched it twice and I'm still getting chills watching it. Bravo!

review/summary: Action-packed and witty
review/text: One of the more highly-regarded superhero movies, I feel "Iron Man" deserves the acclaim. It has some excellent action sequences, but also balances them with a fair amount of drama. The dialogue is witty throughout and the story has a positive message. Each cast member delivers a superb performance, led by the reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.  Taking over his father's company, Tony Stark is responsible for developing and selling modern weaponry to the United States government. While in Afghanistan to show off a new missile system, he is kidnapped by terrorists who want him to create the weapon for them. Instead, Tony creates his first Iron Man outfit. Seeing how the terrorists had been using some weapons created by his company to murder innocents, Tony has a change of heart over selling weaponry and wants the company to cease weapons selling. This doesn't sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who takes care of the company's daily operations and ultimately opposes the change. Tony still goes one step further and develops a more advanced Iron Man outfit to go up against the terrorists.  As for his personal life, Tony Stark is a playboy whose only real constant is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his personal assistant. It soon becomes clear just how much they care for each other. His only other real ally is Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who helps bail Tony out. The scenes with Pepper and Rhodes include many of the better moments, both dramatic and humorous.  This movie works well because the action is well-done without completely overshadowing the drama and humor. The excellent writing, acting, and effects make it an enjoyable movie which loses little to nothing in repeat viewings.

review/summary: Ironman of the Spirit
review/text: Okay, the film has been out for a while so I'll start with four obvious points.  The film is based on a Marvel comic and has been compared favorably with other comic book films; even the other comic `Man' films (`Super', `Bat' and `Spider'.) But an interesting difference between the hero in this film and the heroes of `Superman', `Batman' and `Spiderman' is that those heroes make great effort to avoid deadly force. Batman has a policy against using guns. Superman uses his great powers to jail rather than kill villains almost without fail. Spiderman's villains in the films die because of their own hubris rather than at Spidey's hand (or web or whatever). Iron Man has guns and missiles built into his suit that are intended to kill people, and he does that very thing. Keep that in mind if you're thinking of taking the young'uns. (If you want to know how I think it compares to the other superhero `Man' films, I've ranked them below.)  The cast is great. Gwyneth Paltrow takes the role of Pepper Potts, the loyal assistant that could have been a clich&eacute; and an offense to feminists, and makes the character into a charming blend of strength and vulnerability. Jeff Bridges ably projects ironic menace as Obadiah Stane. Terrance Howard is okay, but not nearly as interesting as he has been in other films. But it's all about the guy who plays Tony Stark, the man who becomes Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in the film. He is the single best reason to buy a ticket. It's fun to see a forty-something year old not so chiseled hero (the power is in the suit). Downey plays the billionaire playboy munitions manufacturer as someone whose top concern is amusing himself. Downey has given similar top drawer performances in such films as last year's Zodiac or A Scanner Darkly from the year before that. But very few people saw those films. (Super hero films tend to be more popular than docudramas about serial killers or animated dystrophic science fiction.) In real life, Downey has struggled with abuse problems, and it's a pleasure to see him in such an entertaining breakout role.  This movie is making a lot of money. It made one hundred million dollars in its opening weekend alone. There has been a drought of exciting popcorn films in theaters, and many are rushing to see a film they hear is just plain fun.  You might want to stay past the final credits to get a hint of sequels to come. As I said, all this has been written about before. So what can I add for the church newsletter? How about a ridiculous comparison to Scripture? Why not? If you can't write silly about a super hero film, what can you write silly about? The first suit worn by Tony Stark in the film is built by the character in a cave in Afghanistan. He is being held hostage by terrorists who want him to build a missile system. He uses the materials system to build a mechanical suit that allows him to escape. When he returns home, he builds a bigger and better suit. So let's take a look at how the armor of Iron Man compares to the armor of God described in Ephesians chapter 6. 10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Right off the bat, we get a big contrast between the two suits. Iron Man's armor is used to protect against flesh and blood. Though for PC reasons the film does not label the terrorists in the film as Muslim, they are quite obviously modeled after the Taliban. Tony Stark has no compunction about killing with bullets those who would kill him or innocent bystanders. Paul makes it clear in this passage that our real enemies are not other people. Those people that seem to be our enemies have been deceived by the powers of darkness, and we must do our best to show love to people who strike out against us. (Note I am not saying here there is not a role for police officers and soldiers to use force to protect the innocent.) But we need to pray for and love those who ridicule Jesus Christ and His teaching, and not treat them as enemies. Paul makes it clear that there are real evil spiritual forces in the world, Satan and his minions along with destructive philosophies and teaching. That is where the battle lies for a Christian. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, In the film, Stark runs a munitions company. When captured by terrorists he sees that they are using his company's weapons for nefarious ends. He then pursues the truth about how they obtained his weapons, knowing the exposure of the truth may have a great financial cost. As Christians, we need to pursue the truth, even if it is costly. As the film begins, Tony Stark is definitely not a righteous man. We see he is a gambler, a heavy drinker and sexually promiscuous. But when a character in the film sacrifices his life for Stark, we see Stark realize that he should not live his life so selfishly. Because someone gave His life for us, we need to pursue righteousness. 15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. Stark's feet are equipped with rocket packs. But I'd argue that God's Spirit can get us where we need to go to share His good news faster and farther. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Stark's whole suit is a shield. His basic power is invulnerability. We have the armor of God, which will not necessarily protect us from illness or pain or poverty. But if we trust Him, it will protect us from the flaming arrows of the evil one that would have eternal, damning consequences. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Stark uses all kinds of offensive weaponry. He has all kinds of guns and missiles and his very armor acts as a weapon. But the sword is the only offensive weapon in God's arsenal. We need to get to know the Bible, the Word of God, well. It's the only weapon of God we have. And all we need. 18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints. Iron Man pretty much fights alone. We, like a real army, need the support of others. We need the prayers of our fellow believers. And we need to pray for them. The kid in me watches Iron Man and thinks, "I wish I had a suit like that." But the Spirit in me says, "You have something better." (Iron Man is rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality and language.) [How Iron Man compares to the Superman, Batman and Spiderman films.  On par with Superman, not at good as Superman II, but far better than the horrible Superman III and Superman IV and the mediocre Superman Returns.  Better than Batman (1966), Batman (1989) and far better than the wretched Batman Returns, Batman Forever and worst of all Batman and Robin. It's not as good as Batman Begins and the jury's still out on The Dark Knight with Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, which will be released July 18th.  On par with Spiderman, not as good as Spiderman II and far better than Spiderman III.]

review/summary: Ironman is Marvels Batman
review/text: I'm a Batman fan, but not that comicbook nerd type that will debate with you "who would win in a fight with....", that's all just stupid. But coming from Batman, Ironman is the closest thing in the Marvel Universe. There isnt much that I like in the Marvel Universe, but Ironman is definitely the top spot for me, and its all due to this movie! I think Robert Downey was the perfect choice for Tony Stark, and John Favreau did a great job directing. There are probably gonna be those that say, "it wasn't true to the comic" waaaa waaa, blah blah blah, who gives a crap! I never read comic book ONE with a marvel title, so the idea of creating these films is to attract people like myself, as well as quell the fans. I think this film did both very well.  As far as the product itself, it has a great amount of extras! I have yet to listen to the commentary, but I expect good things  All in all, it's now made me buy the Civil War series of comics related to this character, so it's worth it on all levels. "Then why not give it 5 stars", you ask? Because I'm a stingy bastard! How's that?

review/summary: You've caught me doing worse things
review/text: So good to drop in long after the 1st-timer reviews, on a really enjoyable film that I've only just seen. Not just that: today's crummy offerings (mostly involving silly brainless teens falling into comic books or video-/Hasbro-based schlock) suck beyond all recognition. That is why IRON MAN takes the prize in my book.  As most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics. Of all, Marvel Comics were my favorites. It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice. In IRON MAN, nothing disappoints. In spite of today's grand cine-tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.  Featuring the dramedy-slapstick talents of Robert Downey, a growling villain in the form of Jeff Bridges, we have as a perfect spice the support of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard. This film will show you what "supporting role" is supposed to mean.  Though there are multinational (presumably Muslim) terrorists, who give Tony Stark his Iron Man initiative, this film is lighthearted, fun, never overbearing and funny as hell. Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'. He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow. Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.  I loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat. When I think of the hatchet job done by Christian Bale to BATMAN....  Here, IRON MAN is overtly political but not in any patronizing, annoying way. Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far. Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good. And IRON MAN IS GOOD!!  Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film. There are explosions, but everything looks and feels so new here. That is a level of skill I just don't see anymore. Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect "this-is-about-to-get-big" cameo at the end, and I nearly jumped out of my seat at that promise--which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.  IRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words.

review/text: A great movie beautifully rendered in Blu Ray.  The extras - making of - are mostly interesting although some get tediously long.  My only complaint was the additional and deleted scenes section did not have the traditional "directors narrative" option so you could hear from the source exactly why the given scene was deleted or what, specifically, it was originally supposed to add to the movie.  I always enjoy that with those and without it  you are just left to guess for yourself.  It makes them a lot less interesting not having it.

review/summary: What's not to love?
review/text: "Iron Man" stars the irresistible Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a rich weapons designer who eventually ends up captured by terrorists in Afghanistan. Stark manages to invent a bionic suit made of iron and escape from his captors, although the experience leads to a shift in his business strategy and an ultimate showdown with his longtime business partner (Jeff Bridges).  I knew nothing about the Iron Man character before seeing this movie, and I wasn't prepared to like this film as much as I did. It's a very character-driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run-of-the-mill action flicks. Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper. "Iron Man" is a hilarious, exciting movie that will definitely make me buy a ticket to see the sequel when it arrives in theatres two weeks from today.

review/text: Iron Man is an excellent movie for anyone, regardless of age. Children can enjoy it because it's understandable to the younger views (and not too violent). Adults can enjoy it be it's fun, witty and entertaining.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Tony Stark to a T. I don't think they could have gotten a better actor to play this character. The story was well written and leaves plenty of room for sequels.  The blu-ray version is very sharp, crisp and has some pretty nice special features.

review/summary: Fantastic Blu Ray Transfer!
review/text: Wow!! What a great Blu Ray transfer!  I'll get to that in a minute, I want to talk about the movie.  What a fantastic movie! I didn't know anything about Iron Man, and didn't know what to expect. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did!  This movie has some very nice plot twists that will keep the viewer engaged.  The movie is about a super smart guy, Tony Stark, who has enough money to be the typical playboy. He has a solid work ethic that has abled him to live the life that he lives and love so much.  He's in Afghanistan taking a joy ride with the US Tropps, when all of a sudden his  humvee  his hit with weapons, weapons that he and his company made. He's taken POW and the baddies want him to make his super secret, super nasty weapon for themselves.  He works pretty much by himself (he has a couple of people helping him) by he's not making the weapon, but making a crude "iron man" to make his escape. He does that, then when he's back home he decides to close down the weapons part of his business. Not everyone is pleased. Tony then take all of his drive and energy and makes "Iron Man" and uses it against the people that held him hostage. Again, not everyone in the US Government is happy with him.  That's all I really want to say on the plot.  This movie has a lot of strengths to it.  I love the way Downey has portrayed Tony Stark.  He gives Stark a lot of charm and depth that we can't help to love.  I honestly didn't think that Downey could pull of the character of Tony Stark, and I'm pleased to say that I was wrong. Downey does a fantastic job!  This has some pretty neat plot twists. I don't want to say what they are, but they're very nice and will keep you glued to the movie.  The Blu Ray is fantastic! The transfer is beautiful.  It has crystal clear images and very life like. A few times I was floored by what I saw. It was that good. The sound is outstanding. It will give the viewer the experience as if they're really there. Nice job. I loved all of the extras to it.  ****SPOILER START*****  There is just one thing that keeps me from giving Iron Man 5 stars. It's the ending. I really didn't like it at all. I mean, Stark told the media, "I am Iron Man." What?!  Why would he do that? He had someone write for him some alibis to prove he wasn't where Iron Man was. It was all set, so why would he tell who he really is? I was just stunned by what he did.  ****SPOILER END*****  Over all, I'd say get this movie and add it to your blu ray collection. It has great visuals, great sound, great extras, wonderful story and  a great plot.  You need to add this to your collection. I can promise you, you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't.

review/summary: Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies out there.
review/text: 2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.  For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in "Tales of Suspense # 39" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivity  As he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.  Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.  Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.  Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes "Iron Man" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while. Loved it.

review/text: In the normal course of my work in this space I don't generally review current commercial films, except when they provide some kind of political or social comment that is in line with those aims. Or when I am feeling a little whimsical or wicked after watching a "light" film that is just pure entertainment. That turns out to be the case here.  Let's face it, how can one seriously knock a film that is based on a comic book character?  Reading about or viewing such characters was virtually a rite of passage for any child, right? Here whiz kid (or elder kid) and mega-rich defense contractor Tony Stark, played very nicely by Robert Downey, Jr., just happens to have had a "conversion" experience in of all places, modern day Afghanistan (if one can accept that as a correct term in that benighted country) as a result of a very close call with the results of his own weaponry at the hands of a Taliban-like organization.  As a result, Brother Stark will not, however,  `go gentle into that good night' and begin to preach some form of pacifism but will turn the nature of modern nasty and brutish  combat on its head and return, via high technology, to the good old medieval days of individual knightly combat. One on one, up close and personal.  Needless to say, that knight will be none other than the whiz kid Stark. Throw in a little off-hand old-fashioned chaste romance with his fair damsel, oops, Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and you have the makings of a very good...comic book story. Kudos for that part.  No kudos, however, for the little premise that was always behind these super-hero adventure stories. Wait on an individual `savior" to come by and save us from ourselves. If we wait for the "white knight" to come and save us from this wicked old world we are in serious trouble. Although this film was fun to watch and a nice spoof I'll stick with the mass plebeian struggle to turn those swords into ploughshares. And by the way, individual knight or massed troops isn't it about time to get out, way out, of Afghanistan now. The comic books, and their very appealing characters, are of no use for use on that proposition though.

review/summary: Brilliant remake for a cold war character
review/text: Ironman is one of Marvel Comics characters that has been around at least in comic form since the early 1960's.  Something attested to by the fact that I had one conversation about this movie while attending a function at a church related retirement community.  When I heard that this movie was being made, I wondered how the film's producers would take a character who was a munitions maker and a superhero and put him on the big screen.  What if public opinion about the current wars became overwhelmingly negative before the movie's release?  In the comics the line was tread by having Tony Stark become an alchoholic during the heavy military expeditures of the 1980's but this was to be a two hour movie. For this movie, Ironman's origin was altered.  This time Tony Stark is injured by one of his own weapons, an idea borrowed from the comicbook origin of the Incredible Hulk.  The metal suit he develops is intended to be a less lethal method of stopping violent terrorists.  After returning to America he shifts Stark Industries away from the production of weapons.  The antagonist is now a war profiteer in his own company. There is just the right amount of comic relief and although some modifications have been made to the Ironman mythos, the story remains true to the spirit of Marvel Comics. Since this movie is deservedly rated PG-13, a version for younger audiences would nice for parents.

review/summary: What a movie!
review/text: How can this be?  A movie based on a comic book character that not only doesn't suck, it actually improves on the original story of the origins of the character!  Unlike most super hero movies, Iron Man is mostly an unknown and therefore easier to work with without totally ruining it for anyone who read and followed the old comics.  That said, this is just a great movie with a smart story and excellent casting.  Absolutely great to own and can't wait for the sequel.

review/summary: A mixed bag
review/text: Undoubtedly Blu Ray reference material - great audio and video.  The story is a big mixed though.  The SX are great, but the story seems forced and artificial.  I'm not a comic book fan at all, and do not know the comic iron man story, so i'm likely at a disadvantage.  however, the antagonist seems to just be there and be a formidable foe, no real development to that plot evolution.  at the same time, this is an action movie first and foremost, so perhaps i'm asking too much.  it just wasn't climactic - the final battle happens, and its not satisfying. otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc.

review/text: My second purchase, in blu-ray, and quality not to be compared. Robert Downey Jr. was born to the role Tony Stark, "Iron Man". Iron Man was not my most favorite Marvel Super Hero, until I saw the Robert Downey Jr. portrayal.  Besides, the surprise tie in, to "The Incredible Hulk" series, "Iron Man" has so many Lives, with Nick Fury, Captain America, and a Marvel~ous World of countless possibilities, and "Armor" to boot.  Have to hand it to "Stan Lee", rising above the "Silver Surfer, and taking a chance, with movies of such Mature Quality.  We need Super Heroes in this day and age...  Thank You Stan.  "Nuff' said!!'

review/summary: More Than Just Heavy Metal Noise
review/text: When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting "Iron Man," I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.  With Black Sabbath's song of the same name pumping up the viewer, it looked like just another empty action film.  Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.  The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.  The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.  Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.  "Iron Man" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.  The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.  The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.  If you do have younger children who want to see this film (and I'm sure there are plenty), I think that a nine or ten year-old could view this with a little guidance from mom and dad.  Highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.  Also, like everybody else seems to be warning, make sure to sit through the entire credits for a brief hint at "Iron Man 2" or perhaps an entirely new film that'll make fanboys jump with glee.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: Cool. That is one word that describes this movie. Exciting and fun are another two. Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.  Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.  This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning. This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances.

review/summary: Superior Tech
review/text: Director Jon Favreau (Zathura & Elf) brings Marvel Comics' armored superhero to the big screen in the first-rate comic book adventure "Iron Man". While demonstrating his company's newest weapon system, billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by Middle Eastern terrorists and forced to build a powerful weapon. Instead, Stark secretly develops a suit of armor to escape his captives. Upon returning to the United States, a renewed Tony Stark is determined to amend his company's mistakes and improves his armor to become the high-tech superhero Iron Man. "Iron Man" is a superb crowd-pleasing summer blockbuster that ranks as one of the best superhero movies to date. The latest comic book adaptation delivers a well-paced storyline, excellent visual effects, good action sequences, a solid cast and great humor. Downey's entertaining performance as Tony Stark is one of the movie's biggest strengths. "Iron Man" also stars Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Academy Award-winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  "Iron Man" arrives on Blu-Ray with a fully loaded 2-disc Ultimate Edition that's a must-have for any Marvel Comics fan. The 2008 blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is very impressive but not quite perfect. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is excellent. "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition features two great documentaries: "I Am Iron Man" that offers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look in the development of the film, and "The Invincible Iron Man" that explores the origins of the Marvel Comics' character. Other bonus materials include four picture galleries, 11 deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers, "The Onion: Iron Man Trailer" gag short, actor Robert Downey Jr's screen test and "Hall of Armor" interactive feature. Overall, "Iron Man" Ultimate Edition scores an "A".

review/summary: Breaking the Mold
review/text: In a decade of interchangable superhero movies desperately trying to enter the Superhero Pantheon, Iron Man is the only one that succeeds in breaking the wanna-be mold and becomes truly fresh and worthwhile. It mixes just the right amount of real world injustice and superhero magic.  The movie never takes itself to seriously and so never becomes too heavy handed or bogged down in psychology. It never becomes too slapstick, and Downey Jr.'s remarkable performance brings to life both the bitterness that makes Tony Stark a believable human being and the fortitude that leads him to make himself into Iron Man.  Stark doesn't care what anyone thinks of him; he's a playboy/weapons mogul who fights injustice because it offends him personally and follows the rules of no other superhero code. Iron Man, too, follows the rules of no other superhero movie; it leaves the impression that the filmmakers did it solely to please themselves, disregarding what the studio or fanboy expect and "Iron Man movie" to be.  And that's what makes it great. Now if only they could continue to ignore precedent and continue the stellar work in the inevitable sequel.

review/summary: For the Future of Mankind
review/text: What makes Iron Man a great movie is that it is virtually void of those moments where you go, "That could never happen." And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an "iron" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.  I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E">Batman Begins</a> and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.  And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.  Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.  The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">Avenging</a> buddies? Either way...I can't wait.  I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ML1G">Iron Man</a> will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.

review/summary: Both my spouse and I had a blast from start to finish
review/text: I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.  The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.  Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.  The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.  The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.  The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of "Iron Man" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both "Detroit Rock City" and "Lords of Dogtown."  Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed "Iron Man" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen.

review/summary: A solid Marvel winner!
review/text: Multi-billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) is the owner of a successful weapons industry. During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into "Iron Man" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.  Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to "Dark Knight". Gwyneth Palthrow co-stars as Stark's sexy secretary Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Colnel Rhodes, it's the greatest Marvel Movie since "X2" or "Spider-Man 2". Downy Jr. definitely nailed the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man well just like Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire to Spider-Man and Christian Bale was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting. It stays true to the origins of the comic books even though a little of the origin is changed to a modern time, it's a truly satisfying and smart superhero movie that knows how to please the audience and critics alike thanks to the magic of it's smart script, great acting and fantastic action sequences with a nifty suprise at the end of the credits of this movie.  This 2-Disc Blu-Ray is mindblowingly fantastic with it's nicely detailed picture and sound that will blow you away. The extras include a 7 part making of Documentary, featurette, Blu-Ray exclusives like Iron Man IQ Test and hall of armor, the actors Process, deleted and extended scenes, a sneek preview of the upcoming Iron Man animated series, Still gallery, and screen-test.

review/summary: From Obscurity to a household name.
review/text: When I first saw the previews of this movie I was a skeptic.  Iron Man was not a household name like Batman or Superman and to be honest I knew very little about the character.  Some might even say he was a "B List" Super Hero as his own adventures never took off very well and he tended to be bundled with other heroes instead of having a long running series of his own.  However this movie just blows those notion away and if they keep at it not only will this be a great franchise for future movies but my guess it will re-kindle the comic book market for this hero as well.  The studio could have taken the easy way out and done this movie as a cheesy action movie with a thin plot which would make for a great summer blockbuster but be easy to be forgotten over time.  Instead they went all out with a rock solid plot that is real, gritty, and believable.  There is a movie here with action, and not just a bunch of action scenes made into a movie (ie Transformers).  The casting was right on and the actors did a great job bringing the characters to life.  Downey just nails the part in every way.  I have never been a fan of his actually as he has always irritated me but he has redeemed himself in Iron Man and I totally rooted for his character.  Everyone else from major parts to even the smaller parts did a wonderful job.  The art work and effects were also just amazing.  The attention to detail just blows my mind.  The suit in particular and how he puts it on made perfect sense and it was great to share the joy of his discoveries with Iron Man.  A lot of movies skip this part and show something bad happening to the main character and then a short 'build sceen' that makes no sense and then they emerge all decked out.  The older Batman movies come to mind where he has all this super tech but no way to explain any of it.  Iron Man explains it so it makes sense and takes you on the journey to building it all and testing through the kinks of the system and its limitations.  Being that this movie was so wonderful with such great special effects and attention to detail, I ended up 'upgrading' to the Blu Ray version.  The Blu Ray difference stuck out soooo much on this already good looking movie.  The level of detail on the suit in particular just made me constantly say "WOW'.  The Blu Ray brought this movie to the next level with sight and sounds along with having a ton of great extra features that my DVD did not have.  In the end I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is one of my favorite movies now.

Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  What's my reservation about the flick?  It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.  It's like the makers of the "Iron Man" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable.  I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good.

review/text: I just flat out love this movie. I'm a middle-aged mom who isn't the biggest action fan in the world, but this movie bowled me over. My young sons weren't sure they wanted to see it at the theater (my younger boy spooks easily and thought Iron Man looked scary on the commercials), so I ended up watching it on a plane last summer. As soon as I saw it, I knew I'd buy the dvd. My husband and both boys love it now, and I think it's my favorite action movie, and certainly my favorite superhero movie (because I don't like any other superhero movies). The film moves along at a breakneck speed, almost as quickly as Robert Downey Jr. talks. This is a fast, clever movie that is by turns seriously moving and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The casting is sublime. Any other actor would have given the movie a completely different tone. I totally bought Downey as the smart-alec (I'm using the nice word) savant with a weakness for women and cars but a sincere desire to do the right thing. I just love this movie! Can you tell?

review/summary: One of Downey's Jr.'s Best
review/text: Robert Downey Jr. has done some good movies these past few years; including some pretty esoteric stuff (Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang - Wonder Boys - Tropic Thunder) but he sometimes borders on the outrageous here as Tony Stark - In a good way.  His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.  Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah "Stane" (was that a subtle hint?) and the "Iron Monger" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's "Hulk" vs. Tim Roth's "Abomination" battles.

review/summary: Only One Thing Could Have Made It Better
review/text: This last year has been a major disappointment for science fiction but there seems to be a veritable glut on superheroes going on now, so I waited to buy Iron Man after I bought The Dark Knight and Hancock, and I can't wait to see Watchmen when that comes to DVD.  Iron Man turned out to be much better than I expected given Marvel's past failures like Daredevil, The Punisher, and as far as I'm concerned, The Hulk. For an origin story, it is well written save for a plot hole or two and very well acted & directed. From beginning to the end credits (and you really have got to wait til the end of the credits or you miss the zinger) this is a really good movie. Not great, but really good. As for the DVD, that's another matter. I was hoping this movie would come in fullscreen like The Dark Knight, The fantastic Four, and other movies where you either bought it fullscreen or as in some cases, you got a disc with widescreen on one side and fullscreen on the other.  Too much of the good stuff gets cut out with widescreen, And I don't know why these companies assume that everyone can afford-- or will even buy a wide screen TV if they could afford it-- and so make movies in only one limited format. Iron Man is already in Blu Ray, so why not fullscreen as well? Then you would have a five star DVD to watch!

PQ - there's edge enhancement, but to most casual viewers (friends and family), the HD picture quality throughout the Iron Man BD is incredible.  use the 'first California flight' scene for the Wow! factor.  great details, 3D pop factor, flesh tones seem correct.  the Dolby Tru-HD audio quality is reference material.  one of the best BD superhero movies to own - recommended!

review/summary: Great example of Blue Ray, good example of a film
review/text: With the price of Blue Ray discs so high I have found myself renting more than buying but there are a few titles out there whose rental convinces me that they are worth spending a little extra. Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray.  As a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very engaging.  So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major villain.  Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis.

review/summary: 5 stars I love the new comics now a days to the ones back in the old days
review/text: They are more realistic then ever. They have drama and curse words and sex and unhappy endings. Just like real life. I've been told I have great taste in movies from a lot of people, friends & family & some people I just met. I read some of the 1 star reviews about this movie. Most of those reviews are stupid people who are picky. One was even mad that the main star in this movie has sex with random women. Big deal! If they have little kids and don't want them to see this movie then don't let them see it. problem solved, I mean have good parenting skills people. It's called common sense! Other people were saying this movie was only special effects. So what that's what makes action movies great. The acting and comedy was there too. I thought it was a kickass movie. Even scientist are trying to make people super human in the future. They gear up are soldiers in iraq pretty hardcore. We can see and shoot around corners without even steping out in dangerous situations. Iron man and the hulk and batman and wanted were all good movies. They made their millions and you see more 5 and 4 star votes on here then you do 1 star soo you know most people liked this movie.

He was able to portray that we are all vulnerable, no matter our circumstances, money or no money.  Stark (of course this representation of Stark isn't exactly like the comic novel) represents the wishful thinking of many Americans. Iron Man was well balanced between comic relief and emotional drama. I enjoyed it, well, then again I am in my early 20s :-]

review/text: "Iron Man" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.  No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, "You are NOT a superhero").  Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.  A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!

Technically though, if you are looking to showcase your hi-def equipment, either Iron Man or The Dark Knight is the way to go.  Crisp vivid transfers, and TrueHD audio make both of these movies tough to beat.  I have to say I enjoyed them much more in my home theatre than in the movie theatre.  With the recent price breaks in Blu-Ray equipment AND movies, there is no better time to buy.  BUY THIS MOVIE~You won't regret it!  Zorro710

review/summary: 2008, a good year for comic fans
review/text: So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.  And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.  Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it's source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.  the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.  I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.  Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, and count how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.

review/summary: We All Are Waiting For the Sequel
review/text: Iron Man was a great success for Marvel.  It continues the super-hero genre, with great creativity and humor.  I would have never thought that Jon Favreau could take on a Marvel franchise and be so successful.  This new string of Marvel financed movies are turning out to be great adaptations.  You're gonna love Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and your going to love the action and adventure.  Iron Man has a lot of great things that will carry it through a big franchise.  Its humor draws a big audience.  It's technological action, with a strong reality wired in, appeases many skeptics and comic bookies alike.  The film has a strong cast which recently went through some changes for the sequel, but I'm sure it will turn out for the better.  Its adaptation from comic to film is very similar to Batman's recent treatment, with a focused concentration on making the character believable.  In any comic book adaptation, I believe you really have to convince the audience that this person would do this.  Besides the great film, the Blu-ray carries a lot of great special features.  I enjoy blocks of video and some picture-in-picture but I dislike Universal's attempt at the rewind, click, rewind, click U-Control.  I was very satisfied by Iron Man's behind the scenes peeks.  To pump you up for the sequel I would say this movie is definately one of those comic book movies you should own.  Behind the helmet, and outside of the helmet, Robert Downey Jr. does amazing justice to the character. I wanted a little more action, but that's what a sequel is for.  Get ready for Iron Man Vs. Mickey Rourke!

review/summary: Very enjoyable superhero movie
review/text: When I was a teenager, I read both Marvel and DC Comics.  My favorite heroes were respectively Iron Man and Batman.  I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.  The best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.  Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in; with this movie, the stars were selected because of their talent.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the only actor I expected to see was Robert Downey, who was as good as the film critics said he was.  Believe it or not, I didn't recognize Gwyneth Paltrow, though she caught my attention with her excellent performance of Pepper Potts.  In the novel "Moonraker" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him.  What does that have to do with "Iron Man"?  Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.  I did not recognize one of my favorite actors.  Again, his talent gave life to the role of Obadiah Stane.  I have, as I grew up, stopped keeping up with the comics though I am usually interested in the Marvel movies.  When I was a teenager, Tony Stark was captured and became Iron Man in Vietnam.  I learned that the story changed twice since then, and the movie follows the current version of Iron Man's origin.  This movie can be considered a little slow in its development.  The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.  This is where the casting helped pull the movie off, because I was kept interested by the portrayals of the actors.  Of course, Stan Lee makes a cameo.  There were a couple of hints of what might come in a sequel (Terrence Howard's character eyeing an armor suit and the mention of SHIELD) that would leave a non-Marvel fan scratching his head and wondering what that was about, which I felt was a chink in the armor of this movie.  Also, I felt the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)  These negative elements won't stop you from enjoying the movie.

review/summary: Robert Downey, Jr. Rocks!
review/text: Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film. Say what you will about his repeat trips to rehab and his "Hollywood Bad Boy" persona, but this is an actor who was truly born to play the title role. You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were adlibbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home. Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen. He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel!

review/summary: An Excellent Superhero Movie
review/text: Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.  Downey stars as Tony Stark, billionaire head of Stark Enterprises.  Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.  After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.  Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.  In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.  This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.  I've seen each of the "Spiderman" and "Batman" movies, and I'd rate "Iron Man" as the best of the superhero films.  Highly recommended.

review/text: This movie has everything lots of action, outstanding special effects and a good story. I think that the people at Paramount nailed the character selection casting Robert Downey Jr to play Tony Stark. The blu-ray version has lots of features and most of them are in HD which is something rare in recent blu-rays (most of them come with Standard Definition extras). I highly recommend this movie to anyone, I saw it by mistake and ended up loving this movie.

review/text: Fantastic casting of Downey as the billionaire industrialist cynical hero, and his mentor mentor Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), as the evil corporate titan profiteering from other people's suffering. (I know it's horribly cliche, but he pulls it off well).  Brilliant plot and more crucially the writing, which offers interest for both the children and the adults, despite being a a comic book hero. Special effects carry the plot along nicely. Recommended to keep around when there's a house full of kids and bored parents sipping hidden scotch.

review/summary: The way action movies should be done
review/text: Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age).  A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion.  He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a "merchant of death," but he balks at being called "the Da Vinci of our time").  Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.  Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and pulverizing the bad guys.  "Iron Man" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards.  But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.  He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made "Iron Man" what it is without him.  Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory.  These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.  James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.  Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in "Iron Man" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie.  It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.  And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be.  It's nice to see that somebody finally got it right.

review/text: Loved this movie.  I am not partial to super-hero movies, but watched this one after my kids (ages 14 and 12) watched it on their Air France flight and loved it themselves.  This is not your typical super hero movie, it's better.  Perhaps because the story of Iron Man as told in the comic books has more pragmatic beginnings, this movie is believable.  Excellent acting all around, excellent use of humor.  I've purchased it for gifts for my master stylist (who also loved it), and my brother (who turned me on to the 'bad' comic books like Iron Man and Batman when I was into the 'good' comics like Tweety and Slyvester).  I sure hope the ending suggests a sequel!

review/text: For those of who you haven't seen Iron Man, I won't speak much about the movie itself; there are more than enough places for movie reviews.  What I will say is that this Blu-Ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home.  The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi-speaker systems.  Using the PCM stream, you can appreciate individual bullets in different areas and some more subtle sounds during the battle sequences that you may not have noticed.  This movie is probably one of my favorites to show off sound effects.  All in all a very nice way to enjoy your home theater and a fun movie to watch.

review/summary: 2-Disc Set Does Iron Man Justice!
review/text: There is a lot to `give away' in describing "Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.  He is the rowdy billionaire responsible for building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the enemy who then turns into a reluctant and then powerful `Iron Man'.  The cinematography is stunning in Blu-ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over-whelming.  The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.  Plus, it is all believable.  Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused as his assistant, but she supplies some killer one-liners.  Jeff Bridges plays a role that truly threatens Iron Man, but that's all I'll say.  The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.  On Blu-ray disc, it is just as good as being in a movie theater - the details, color and sound are that amazing!  Tony Stark IS `Iron Man'.  All Blu-ray discs are set up differently according to their theme, but for Iron Man, I'll describe the screen imagery.  The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.  Audio is available in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.  These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test'. 'The Actors Process' (Downing and Bridges get down with some real improvisations), a semi-spoof trailer from `The Onion' on Iron man,' Theatrical Trailers, Galleries, Credits and Subtitles.  Not to leave anything out, more extras include six mini features such as `Friends and Foes' and "Demon in a Bottle".  If you're really into Blu-ray, try connecting to the Internet for BD-Live capability. This is one of the Blu-ray features that put it so far and above regular DVD.

review/summary: ROBOCOP ON STEROIDS
review/text: If you liked Robocop, you definitely love IRONMAN.  But at the same time, this movie tells the story of a few things that are true and going as we breathe.  One thing that p***** me off is that we have terrorists in our own country under our noses and they are being covered up.  They are probably committing illegal acts right now.....Just think about how Jeff Bridges betrayed Morton Junior.  Also, this movie proves to me that the government(certain politicians and leaders) is good at only one thing.....covering up lies, cheating, killing, stealing, and manipulating.  But if you have a closed mind and is naive, you will only see and hear what you want.

review/text: As a person that attends movies on a weekly bases, I definitely agree that Iron Man movie was the num #1 movie of 2008, followed or pretty much tied with the Batman movie: Dark Knight. I'm really huge on comic books turned movies as long as there done the right way, and so I'm glad to give this movie 5 stars & definitely glad to own it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray dvd came in a timely manner as stated so I appreciate that.

review/summary: The Ultimate Superhero Movie
review/text: Indeed, the title speaks for itself. The feature film is an outstanding example of a concise and focused plot, believable and impressive visual effects and masterful performance from the main lead. In regard to the product itself, I thank Amazon for the prompt delivery before the predicted date. But still, 12 days is an agony for me here in Malaysia. Nonetheless, the quality of this blu-ray release is well worth the wait. The video and audio is nothing short of mesmerizing. I'm watching it on my PS3 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. But my only qualm is i've noticed that the video is a little grainy in parts. I wonder if this is common with every blu-ray. On to the special features, i especially enjoyed the tie-in of the making-of documentary to its comic-book roots. Getting to know the origin and the artist and writers that have been involved with Iron Man is rather fulfilling. Also, the detailed approach in explaining the effects and such contributed much to my enjoyment. Robert Downey Jr's screen test, the theatrical trailers, hall of armors is a nice and welcomed edition. Not to mention, the BD-Live feature. All in all, its a money well spent. Iron Man will definitely paved the way for me to own more Blu-ray releases in the future. I wholly recommend Iron Man (Ultimate Two-Disc Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]  !!

review/summary: Downey is magnificent, the origin/epiphany tale is good, and the suit ROCKS!
review/text: This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)  IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, "Huh? Downey?"  I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.  The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.  The effect of his "heart" is also quite nifty, though less complex.  Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.  POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:  I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.  On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.  Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.  The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.  The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.  When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.  Oh, yeah.  And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.  Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.  Mir

review/summary: Such A Cool Movie
review/text: Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.  To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.  Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.  All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed.

review/text: The Dark Knight wasn't surprising... Everyone KNEW it was going to be AMAZING - and it was just that... AMAZING! ...but there were many who doubted that Iron Man would be a good superhero movie. Surprise, surprise. It ROCKED!  Robert Downy Jr. was P E R F E C T in this role. He WAS Tony Stark. The effects were great. The story was entertaining. It stayed pretty true to the comic book. The supporting cast was wonderful (I really enjoyed Jeff Bridges in his role). The end could have been a little more "satisfying"... ...but overall, it was a very, very entertaining film. Oh, and the line before the credits rolled (I'm pretty sure it was the last line of the movie) was great!  I still believe that The Dark Knight was the best summer movie to be released this year, and for that matter, the best superhero movie ever made, but I think Iron Man is right up there with the best.  Bottom line: Great movie.

review/summary: High Praise for the Latest Marvel Movie
review/text: Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.  Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.  The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.  The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!

review/summary: Summer gets an iron boost!
review/text: The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful. Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.  This time the Iron Man-to-be, Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.), is a weapons manufacturing billionaire, not a nerdy college student. He doesn't need to buy a car to win over his childhood sweetheart, but instead has a super-sized garage with six cars and an assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets rid of his one night stands. In short, he lives it up in all the luxury one could dream of.  While visiting a US base in Afghanistan to sell more of his weapons, the humvee he is riding is ambushed and he is taken captive by Afghani insurgents. They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit! A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one. Seeing the destruction of his weapons when they fall into the hands of insurgents he wants to shut down his weapons company. This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.  The casting was perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part as the fast-talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant. Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.  Iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise. Unfortunately with it being a good beginning, is where it faltered, only a little. First you could really tell it was setting up for more as there are actually very few scenes of Iron Man flying around (there are actually many more scenes of Tony building and testing his Iron Man suit) and secondly the end battle was not as spectacular or even intense as most superhero climaxes and ended rather quickly.  Still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint. The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!

review/summary: A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disapoint
review/text: Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 "which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.    Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well.

review/summary: Whoa!
review/text: Let me say: A lot of times I go to a movie with high expectations and, though the movie may be good, come out disappointed. I entered Iron Man with HIGH expectations, and came out as satisfied and awe struck as is possible.  First, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man. He positively owns the part, stealing the show in pretty much every scene he is in. However, let us not take away from the good performances given by the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. The acting is excellent, partly due to the screenplay, which is well paced and funny.  With all the superhero movies coming out today, this one ran the risk of being too much like the others; not standing out enough. However, that risk was quickly abolished, in my mind, by a couple things:   Robert Downey Jr. is so good as the title character...I just can't say it enough.   The Iron Man armor is AWESOME!  3. In my review for Batman Begins, I state the one of the reasons I like it was because the hero didn't actually posses super-human abilities. This one goes even farther in that way: This film is actually set in the real world. Instead of struggles in a city that doesn't exsist, Iron Man is set in the world we live, and therefore we can relate to the story more, as the enemies facing the hero are, more or less, the ones facing us today.  Iron Man is my new favorite superhero, and he may very well become yours. Six stars.

review/text: Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.  Now this is what you get for the BD version:  Blu-ray Disc 1:  Hall of Armor The Invincible Iron Man Origins Friends & Foes The Definitive Iron Man Demon in a Bottle Extremis and Beyond Ultimate Iron Man Deleted/Extended Scenes BD Live: Iron Man IQ  Blu-ray Disc 2:  I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins The Suit that makes the Iron Man The Walk of Destruction Grounded In Reality Beneath the Armor It's All in the Details A Good Story, Well Told Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast) The Onion "Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film" Theatrical Trailers Image Galleries  Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made.

review/summary: Action, Humour, Drama and Special Effects - Perfectly Blended
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's one of those rare events where I felt as though someone had climbed into my head and figured out what I'd like. The special effects never get in the way. You kind of only know they are there because, well, we know we can't do some of that incredible stuff in real life today - not yet anyway.  When I heard Robert Downey Jr. was playing the lead part, I had my doubts, but I now stand convinced he was/is the right guy for the role.  I hope though that the criminals in the next installment have higher IQs than those in this one. At the beginning when Tony Stark was captured and locked in the cave, why would they place him in a room full of weapons to make weapons, not put men in the room to supervise him directly and not expect him to use all that technology to break out? After all, he is a well reknown genius.  Nevertheless, this movie is definitely watchable and re-watchable. Jeff Bridges worked well in the movie too, though I couldn't help thinking he was playing Kris Kristofferson playing the role of Obadiah.  All said, it is, in a word, fantastic.

review/summary: Proabaly one of the best super hero movies I've ever seen!
review/text: I am IRON MAN. It's about as epic as it sounds.  I didn't go in to the theater with high expectations. But, after the movie was over I was speechless.  This movie has everything from comedy to action.  Iron Man opens with a breathtaking view of a desert.  Not bad.  Then you find out that it's in Afghanistan and the warm and fuzzy feeling fades away.  A military car comes into view fallowed by some rock music.  Still a bit confused.  That scene in the car with Dowry Jr. is probably one of the best scenes in the movie.  Not for class but for comedy.  And he doesn't miss a beat throughout the entire film.  The director does a good job of easing you into the movie and then he hits you with an explosion.  After that the movie cuts to a flash back of Tony Stark's life and what he is all about.  This movie can be a little confusing at first but its work the confusion.  Iron Man is warm, funny, action-packed and very visual.  Whoever came up with the costume design for the suit is a genius. If you have a chance I would definitely recommend this movie.  Anyone will love it.

review/summary: Great movie!
review/text: Given the spate of disappointing superhero movies over the years, I wasn't terribly excited about "Iron Man."  I probably would never have watched it if my wife hadn't wanted to rent it.  I'm glad she did, or else I would have missed a fun and entertaining movie.  Robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.  It's a measure of the writing and direction that film could have succeeded with a different actor as Tony Stark.  But Downey really took the reins and put an indelible mark on the character all his own.  He completely owned every scene he was in.  "Iron Man" successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.  Favreau and Downey deserve equal credit for that.  And Favreau does a great job of keeping "Iron Man" moving.  Who would have thought back in the day of "Swingers" that Favreau would become a big-time A-list director?  Hollywood often fails to notice talent, so it's great to see him succeed.  The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.  Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller; be sure to watch until the very end!  I highly recommend this movie to fans of action movies, superhero films, SF movies, or anyone who just plain enjoys a good movie.

review/text: Ironman is right up there with the other heroes. Yet he seems closer to being human than the others. Maybe it's his clumsiness? Whatever the case Robert Downey Jr. did a great job. Now for the movie....yes its funny and something for the entire family but could use a little more depth. Afterall Spidey and Batman have some serious issues brewing (criterion/prerequisite for being a superhero). Perhaps we could see that in Ironman 2? Sometimes you have to run before you can walk...what a riot.

review/text: Iron Man is one hell of a fun ride.  Yes, The Dark Knight might be the better film, and yes it might be a little shallow sometimes, but Iron Man is still my preference.  Its a fun, enjoyable romp, that sets up the franchise.  The actual reason I wrote this review though?  This DVD is NOT region locked.  If your in the UK, you can play this Blu-Ray.  What does this mean?  No getting ripped off, no having to wait forever to get an ultimate edition over here, you can just order this one.

Turn off DRC to get the full effect!  (On the PS3 go to Settings-->Video Settings-->DRC and set to OFF).

review/summary: MARVEL Finally, Makes a Great Comic Book Movie After All its Flops
review/text: With all the crappy movies that Marvel was dishing out recently (Spider-Man 3, Both Fantastic 4 movies, Electra, The Hulk, & The Punisher) I was a little skeptical as 2 whether or not I wanted 2 see this movie. Now I will admit that I am not an Iron-Man fan. In fact I knew almost nothing about him until I saw this movie but, after I left the movie theatre I wanted 2 know more about Iron-Man.   The reason why I loved this movie was Bcause of the character of Tony Stark/Iron-Man(played by the incredible Robert Downey Jr.). He is in many ways similar 2 Bruce Wayne/Batman(he's rich, a genius, runs a huge corporation, and in his spare time fights the bad guys in a really sweet costume). Now I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I think Batman fans will love this movie & see the similarities & Differences Btween Bruce Wayne & Tony Stark.   RDJr. really inhabited the role of Iron-Man mostly Bcause in many ways RDJr. is a lot like Tony Stark. My favorite scenes in the movie R when he is trying 2 test the parts 2 his suit. It showed RDJr.'s ability 2 be funny(even though he was getting tossed around the room a lot). Even though there's a lot of CGI in this movie and we really don't get 2 C Iron-Man punch a lot of people around I will agree that this movie was indeed one of the best summer movies I've ever scene. This movie really sprang Marvel back from its recent years of really bad movies. I strongly recommend anybody 2 C this movie if U didn't C it in theatres. Believe me U will want 2 C it over & over again.

review/summary: The Age of Iron Begins
review/text: Iron Man was a lesser-known hero in the Marvel universe.  He wasn't as well known as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, or the Fantastic Four.  Therefore, it was a bit surprising that in their freshman film as an independent film company that Marvel would choose Iron Man as the hero that their future would either be built or destroyed upon.  All doubts, however, have been put aside as 2008 has come to be the year that comic book movies became serious works of cinematic art, beginning with the release of IRON MAN.  IRON MAN revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire whose fortune was built upon arms manufacturing to defend the free world from totalitarianism, tyranny, and terrorism.  Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.  While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.  The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.  They want Stark to build them a replica of the missile he just created for the U.S. Army.  Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.  After returning to the United States, Stark decides that his company, Stark Industries, is no longer going to be in the arms manufacturing business.  Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.  He's convinced by his partner and good friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) to take some time off.  Stark uses that time to prefect the suit he created in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Stane has plans of his own and the direction Tony wants to take the company in doesn't fit in Obadiah's plans.  IRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.  The acting is solid, the script well-written, and the direction superb.  The movie completely revived the career of Robert Downey, Jr. and turned Jon Favreau from being just a comic and family-film director into being a major directorial player.  Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.  When one thinks about it, IRON MAN is the type of movie that SUPERMAN RETURNS should have been a couple years ago.  I guess iron really is stronger than steel.

review/text: next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.  Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed.  I actually had FUN watching this in the theater.  The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.  Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.  I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line.

Otherwise, great acting, interesting story, and it's fun (which is something you cannot say about Dark Knight).

The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok. Now, there is a small portion of plastic removed from the side of the case( not the one where you open the case), it looked like someone bit that portion of plastic off. Im going to buy the new INCREDIBLE HULK dvd, so please AMAZON, be more careful with my next dvd. Anyway, trailers of the new Hulk, deleted scenes, NEW startrek trailer, so single disc is great if you dont want to spend more cash for the extra disc. I dont think anyone appreciates if their dvds came in damaged cases. The front and the back pictures are safe. Just that portion on the side. EXCELLENT MOVIE.

review/summary: The Start of Something Big...(Book 1: Part 1)
review/text: Since X-MEN hit the big screen in 2000 the comic book film had taken a huge leap forward. With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)  Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.  This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.

Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.  Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.  The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.  I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.  I could not recommend this movie any higher, it is a must see if your into this sort of action fick.

My 11 year old son and I have seen enough movies together to be able to separate good movies from great ones, and this will stand out as one of the great movies of 2008 and one of the best of the comic book movie genre, even rivaling the Batman series. It's light years ahead of any of the Superman movies, making them seem childish and almost corny.  If you haven't seen the movie in the theatre, don't over-analyze or over-think the purchase of the DVD. It will be well worth it to buy it because you'll most likely want to see it again.

review/summary: Great superheroes aren't made - they're built.
review/text: Iron Man is without a doubt, Marvel's next hit franchise. You could say it's the new "Spider-Man" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter.  How great is Iron Man? Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times. Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even. It could be this summer's top movie just as Transformers was 2007's.  Iron Man reminds me a lot of the first Spider-Man film in how the story is not terribly complex but dynamic enough with everything else solid. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B.A. businessman & engineer. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Pepper Potts, Stark's secretary and love interest, is able to successfully act with Downey Jr. so that their two characters show authentic chemistry. Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.  Industrial Light & Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man. Although it didn't blow me away like Transformers visuals did, the movie's effects were top notch quality and made the experience all the more enjoyable. It seemed like an interesting, maybe even risky choice to have the musical score consist mainly of guitar-heavy, rock-like tracks but it turned out completely fitting with Tony Stark's personality and the mechanical brawn of Iron Man.  All I can say to finish this review is to go see Iron Man if you haven't. Do not miss out on one of the best summer blockbusters of 2008!

review/summary: Iron Man--Works...And Then Some
review/text: Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews.  One is left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too quickly.  Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and casting.   Well...THAT WAS SETTLED.   What we found out was that RDJ was not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying, hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment.  There were many who thought that Oded Fehr (Of "The Mummy" and "Resident Evil" movies) was the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal history with alcohol and drugs can't be dismissed in this casting--is nothing short of brilliant.  At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that Downey becomes the performer we saw in "Chaplin".   The casting is incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrow's return to work as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges' take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howard's military liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or sequels) being set up through the movie--Howard's looking at the second suit and saying "someday..." prepares us for War Machine, and the terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an obvious reference to The Mandarin...   But this movie ultimately is made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to casting Tony Stark.  He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that, "Iron Man" works... AND THEN SOME.

review/summary: Iron Man
review/text: While visiting Afghanistan, billionaire arms supplier Tony Stark (Downey) finds his caravan overrun by terrorists and himself captured.  Injured in the kidnapping, he finds a n irremovable piece of shrapnel in his chest.  He must wear an electromagnet to keep it from piercing his heart.  The terrorists want him to replicate his latest and greatest missile for them to use.  Stark has other plans, and is able to fashion a suit of armor that allows him to escape captivity.  Back home, he decides to stop his company from making military weapons, and focus on perfecting his metal suit.  "Iron Man" is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with "Batman Begins" and "Spider-Man 2".  It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.  The story of the self-made superhero is different and interesting.  Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.  He IS Tony Stark, and he is at least as responsible for the greatness of this film as director Jon Favreau.  Favreau would not be the obvious choice for a film of this nature, but he pulls it off spectacularly.  "Iron Man" is a great movie for all ages.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great CGI and Robert Downey Jr. has the best superhero personality
review/text: This has to be included with the biggest SuperHero movies now. You would think that these would at least become slightly predictable but no, this movie is a totally original Genre movie. I was amazed to find the opening scenes in the dispelling deserts of Afghanistan! From the get-go Robert draws your attention to his millionair personality, and he gets away with it because he's a quirky kind of guy. I'm glad Roberts Bad days are behind him and that he has his Giant Success now. Best movie of the year, and I'm sure it's one of the best reviewed also. What could they be complaining about? It's a fantastic story, with rich characters and the best CGI this year. I look forward to the sequel slated to come out sometime in. Now that I think about it a little more, why can't we say that for now, this is an Oscar Worthy performance by big-time actor Robert Downey Jr.? I don't want to imagine this movie with anyone else. And STRONG performances by Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as the Iron Monger and the beautiful and flirty Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. The CGI was Fantastic! Jeff Bridges sits inside the menacing Iron Monger as if it were right in front of you. Witty, Funny, Alarmingly FUN! Best SuperHero movie since...Since my personal favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>

review/summary: Grab the popcorn and enjoy an Iron-clad summer HIT!
review/text: One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action-packed thrill ride!  Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!    Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in "Chaplin", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!    Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.    Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.    Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!

review/summary: Iron Man lives again!
review/text: After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.  That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.  The final line of the film is perfect.

review/summary: Great adventure flick!
review/text: Saw it in the theater.  The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.  Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)  Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the "bad" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.  Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)

review/summary: MARVEL HITS ANOTHER HOME RUN! AN INVINCIBLE INSTANT CLASSIC!
review/text: Like most fans of Marvel Super Heroes, I couldn't wait to see this movie! So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or "ol' Shellhead"....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now. Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films. I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider-Man movie twice. I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this! 'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!  A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN! Like all superhero movies should be....go see this movie!..and stay through the credits for a great cameo setting up the next installment......oh yes, there will be another!

review/summary: Robocop was better...
review/text: Judging by all the accolades given to this movie you'd think it was the greatest thing ever invented by Man.  Calm down, people!  It's just a movie!  Yet another in the long, too long, line of superhero franchises.  It has its moments and Downey can be funny.  But if you want the true Man-in-high-tech-armor-fights-bad guys film than you need to see Robocop.  In truth, there are so many similarities, plot-wise, that you could easily argue it's a rehashing of the 80's classic: man is critically wounded, has a second life inside an impervious suit, finds out he was betrayed, has showdown with a similarly super-powered but much bigger foe, etc.  Sure, the special effects are kinda' cool, but Robocop's is even more impressive, especially when you consider they did it the old-fashioned way -- using real models, no CGI. And for true biting satire and gallows humor you can't beat it.  Ah, they don't make `em like they used to anymore.  PS -- It feels like the movie has a pro-military stance in that Stark's weapons are never shown to kill civilians ("collateral damage") when used by the US military, which is what I was expecting.  Instead you only see terrorists using his state-of-the-art weapons (which would be a lot less likely; terrorists tend to be pretty low-tech).  That kind of "black and white" portrayal was odd.

review/summary: Let the Armor Wars begin!
review/text: I had high expectations going into this movie. Iron Man is far and away my favorite comic book character. I've read nearly every Iron Man comic ever issued, and had some pretty unshakeable ideas of what an Iron Man movie should be. I expected a lot from Marvel on this one, though after seeing what a mess they made of Daredevil (my second favorite Marvel character); I was trying to maintain a cautious optimism.  I needn't have worried. Iron Man was an absolutely incredible movie, and is an example of what a perfectly executed super-hero movie should be. I knew a good chunk of the movie would be focused on Iron Man's origin story, and I thought it was handled well. Setting it in Afghanistan instead of Vietnam was a smart move that kept things relevant. Everything that followed - Tony's return, the development of the real Iron Man suit, and the Stane confrontation - was handled just as well. The fact that Stane, an arguably obscure character in the Iron Man series, was used at all was a bold move, and one that I thought paid off.  The movie's main asset was the strength of its cast. Robert Downey Jr. flat-out owns the Tony Stark role. I couldn't picture anyone playing Stark in the first place, but once he was announced I couldn't picture anyone else taking the role. His performance was brilliant, and his Stark was the perfect blend of the old school industrialist Stan Lee originally created and the boozing playboy Mark Millar depicted in the Ultimates. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was just as impressive. His physical presence was every bit as dominating as his business tactics, and while I knew from the start he was a bad guy, I couldn't help but like his character. The rest of the casting was less inspired, and more prone to lazy stereotyping. Damsel in distress? Check. Whiny sidekick? Check. Swarthy Arab terrorists? Check. That and the constant product placement are my only real gripes with the movie, and they're pretty minor, all things considered.  As much as I hate CGI, I have to admit the Iron Man suit was a thing of beauty. I thought it looked sufficiently realistic throughout the movie, not to mention completely cool. Adi Granov (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785122583">Iron Man Vol. 1: Extremis</a>) designed the definitive Iron Man suit of the past 20 years, and it was good to see it used in the movie. Iron Monger was a bit less impressive, but I can admit it was fanboy heaven watching the two armored titans slug it out. Speaking of fanboy heaven, the scene following the credits sent chills down my spine. Talk about taking a page from the Ultimates!  Needless to say, I absolutely loved Iron Man. It did justice to the character, established another viable franchise for Marvel, and has to be ranked as one of the best super-hero movies ever.

review/summary: A bunch of fights and metal armor
review/text: Based on Stan Lee's comic book, "Ironman" comes to the big screen. "Ironman" seems as an appealing superhero movie inasmuch as it has action sequences, a genuine script, and a pleasant acting.  "Ironman" is the story of this inventor/armsdealer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the inheriting owner of an arms company. He has a playboy personality, that's why he is always surrounded by women (most of them models). So, he was in Afghanistan testing his new weapon for selling to the U.S. Army, when suddenly there is an explosion and he is kidnapped by a terrorist group of this region. Then, while he is imprisoned; he creates a special metal suit, in order to get out of that place.  On his way back to the United States, he calls for a press conference and informs them that his company is no longer going to manufacture weapons. After this swift decision, he gains some opponents. Another day, he was working in his lab when he saw on television how evil the Afghan terrorists were with innocent people; at this, he gets mad and decides to improve his suit, but now, he uses better materials and equipment, so he can fight against them.  A positive element in this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, 2003), is the special effects which we can notice in the engaging action scenes, also the locations where these fights are being held are fantastic, and the high technology used in the movie is amazing. The concise and accomplished script is funny and engaging, too, we can understand well the personality of each character, it has some funny lines (typical of Marvel's films) and there is a contrastive variety of scenes and situations that are going to keep you glued to your seat.  The most remarkable point in this movie is the main characters' awesome acting. One of the best performances is Gwyneth Paltrow's, starring as Pepper Potts, Stark's lovable and reliable assistant who has a fresh look. She is always taking care and worrying about him. She also organizes his life; for example, she arranges his dates, his work, and his house. Pepper calls to mind Alfred, the majordomo on "Batman", because they both keep their friends' superhero identity in secret. On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. can perform brilliant roles, such as: "The Singing Detective" (2003), as a superdetective, and "Tropic Thunder" (2008), as an Australian who plays a black man; for this role, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Now, he is a super hero and it is a role that matches for him as well. The supporting roles are also remarkable: we got Terrence Howard as Stark's military buddy Rhodey and Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane. Director Jon Favreau has also one scene minor role as Tony's driver and the comic writer Stan Lee has a brief part, too, as an old man in a party with some girls around him (Hugh Hefner type).  "Ironman" (2008), a Paramount Pictures movie, is rated PG-13 for action sequences and violence. Running time: 126 minutes.

review/summary: Great Superhero Fun
review/text: Iron Man is a superhero film that bucks a great many conventions.  The hero is somewhat less-than-virtuous particularly at the start, and has what appear to be almost crippling flaws.  A violent encounter with enemies armed with his own weapons wakes his ethical mind up as well as his engineering talent.  He is a hero out to right a wrong that was done by that which he was responsable...weapons manufactured by his own company in the hands of violent, vicious people.  The change he goes through is entertaining and gradual...you don't really get any superheroics until about halfway through (unless you count his spectacular escape).  Best of all, the final line of the film throws one of the most cherished traditions of superheroes out the window entirely...and it's all the better because it's so in character for the new Tony Stark. As shiny as The Dark Knight was dark, Iron Man is an excellent entry into the superhero genre.

review/text: -  The Iron Man bust is small at about 1:6 scale, but has a solid weight and attention to detail that even non-collectors will notice.  The $50 gift card is good through 2009, and more then covers the extra cost for the set.  Those inclined to want the mini bust will likely find many more of their geek interest covered by the dozens of items  available on Sideshow Collectibles gift card approved list.   -  The movie case is the full standard multi-disc retail package, so I won't comment on it beyond mentioning two points.  One; it will likely be the Canadian (French/English) cover design with the same disc content as in the US.  Two; it's worth buying the slightly more expensive Blu-ray version if you have an HDTV home theater.   -  IF this sounds like a silly waste of an extra $20-$30, then pass... it's not for you.  However, those who like this kind of set won't be disappointed.  This isn't some cheap bit of molded plastic, it's a genuine collectible.

review/summary: Great movie, no frills DVD
review/text: As a movie, Iron Man is one of the better superhero flicks to come out in recent years. If "The Dark Knight" hadn't come out the same year, it would have been unquestionably the best superhero movie in several years. Even then, it holds its own.  Real-life troubled celebrity Robert Downey, Jr. plays fictional troubled celebrity Tony Stark, who through a personal trauma changes his ways and becomes a self-made hero. Like Batman, a lot of Iron Man's allure is that he has no superpowers; he is fully human, using tools that are available to him. The movie is similarly human, with drama, humor and a touch of the poignant.  The DVD itself has the movie and just a few special features, like extra scenes. If you're buying the DVD for the movie, this is a great options, but if you like your special features spend a few dollars more and get one of the deluxe editions.

review/summary: IRON MAN ROCKS!
review/text: I can't imagine anybody else portraying Tony Stark better than Robert Downey Jr. I walked out of the theater at the end of the movie glad that the movie turned out so much better than expected...  Full synopsis below:  The movie begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) visiting soldiers on duty in the Middle East. He is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona. Suddenly, the convoy is attacked. The soldiers fight to defend themselves but are quickly killed. Stark flees when a bomb (bearing the logo of his company, "Stark Industries") explodes, severely wounding Tony's chest. Tony is captured and recorded by a group of terrorists.  A flashback sequence reveals Tony's history as a child prodigy before taking over his father's technology company at age 21. Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) attends a ceremony to present Tony Stark with an award for his work, but Stark is not in attendance. Tony's right-hand man (and his father's former partner) Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) accepts the award in Tony's honor. Rhody later finds Tony partying in a casino. On his way out, a reporter named Christine (Leslie Bibb) approaches Stark with some questions regarding the ethics of his weapons business. Stark deflects her questions with some swift quips and the two end up spending the night together.  Next morning, Christine is awakened by a voice on a computer monitor. It's JARVIS, the artificial intelligence program responsible for running Tony's house. Christine is greeted by Tony's assistant, "Pepper" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she leaves the house. Pepper helps Tony catch up on some business before Tony heads out to the airport where his plane is kept.  In flight, Tony talks with Rhody. Rhody is unhappy about Tony's lax attitude, and Tony tries to get his old friend to relax. Before long they are drunk and leering at the stewardesses.  Tony arrives at a military outpost in the Middle East to demonstrate his company's latest project - the Jericho, a super-missile system. After the demonstration, Tony gets a phone call from Obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well. Tony goes off with the convoy that is soon attacked by terrorists.  Much later, Tony regains consciousness in a cave. His chest is hooked up to a strange device. Another captive, named Yinsen (Shaun Tomb), explains that he operated on Stark but was unable to remove all the shrapnel fragments from the bomb blast. Yinsen created a device - essentially a battery-powered magnet - that will keep the remaining fragments out of Tony's heart.  The terrorists who captured Tony & Yinsen enter the room. Yinsen translates; they want Tony to build them a Jericho missile. Tony refuses, so they begin to torture Stark.  Hours later, the terrorists show off a huge stockpile of weapons-all made by Stark Industries. Tony appears to relent and start building the missile, but has other plans. With Yinsen's help, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company's headquarters. The power output is enough to run Stark's heart for fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes.  Tony designs a way out for them - a powered weapon suit that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. Midway through construction, the head of the terrorist group (The Ten Rings), a man named Raza (Faran Tahir) arrives and attempts to torture Yinsen, angry because he thinks Stark is not working on the Jericho as they wanted. Raza gives them one more day to finish.  Working overnight, Yinsen straps Tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. They set off a bomb inside the cell as a distraction for the guards as Tony powers up his suit. Yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. He grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.  Tony, fully powered, muscles his way through the cave. The guards try to stop but his suit easily deflects their weapon fire. Half-way out, Stark finds Yinsen, mortally wounded. Yinsen reveals that this was his plan, sacrificing himself so Tony could escape, as Yinsen's family is already dead and he will now see them again. Tony tearfully thanks Yinsen for saving him. Yinsen's last words to Stark are not to waste his second chance.  Tony turns his suit on the terrorists, igniting flame-throwers. He destroys their stockpile of weapons and uses a rudimentary jet-pack to blast away from the captive zone. Not long after firing, his jet-pack explodes and he crashes in the desert, but survives.  Stark hikes through the desert until a couple of US helicopters fly overhead. A group of soldiers, led by Rhody, come across Tony. Rhody is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.  Tony returns to the United States after three months in captivity. Pepper wants Tony to receive medical treatment, but Tony states that there are only two things he wants: an American cheeseburger and a company press conference. Shortly after, Tony appears before a group of reporters and announces that he intends to shut down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing division immediately. At the same time, Pepper is approached by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement & Logistic Division agency. They want to talk to Tony Stark about his capture. Pepper schedules an appointment for them.  That evening, Obadiah confronts Tony about his actions, furious. Obadiah knows that the stock value for their company (and, by extension, their financial status) is going to take a serious drop because of this announcement. Tony wants Stark Industries to move forward with arc reactor technology, but Obadiah thinks that the arc reactor is nothing but a publicity stunt. Through the conversation, Tony ends up revealing his prosthetic power-heart to Obadiah. Stane convinces Tony to lay low for a while so the company can sort things out.  Pepper watches a news report on the declining value of Stark Industries when Tony asks for her help. He's created an upgraded mini arc reactor, but can't install it into his chest without someone to help. Pepper accidentally yanks out the cords for the old reactor too soon, putting Tony on the verge of cardiac arrest. They manage to complete the process in time. Tony tells Pepper to get rid of the old model since he's not a sentimental person.  Tony comes to visit Rhodes and asks for help with a new private project. Rhody does not agree with Tony's approach; he thinks Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture and needs time to recover.  Tony turns to his other best friend - JARVIS, the A.I. program - for help. Tony's plan is revealed to be an upgrade to his armored suit (referred to as "Mark 2," with the suit from the terrorist cave being Mark 1).  Meanwhile, the terrorists who held Tony captive are searching the desert, gathering all fragments of the original armored suit.  Tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armor's flight system. Since the leg-mounted jets prove too unstable, he creates arm-mounted stabilizers to balance out the system. Pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon. Pepper leaves a box on Tony's desk.  Obadiah visits Tony and reveals that the board of directors have filed an injunction to gain control of Stark Industries. Tony isn't worried; he still maintains controlling interest in Stark Industries.  Tony finally manages to perfect his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.  A new armored suit is soon finished, looking like a heavily-streamlined version of Tony's Mark 1 armor. Tony connects with Jarvis to monitor the progress in the suit. Tony decides to take it out for a test flight, and he is thrilled by everything the suit can do. Tony decides to push the limit for higher-atmosphere flying, but at such great heights the suit becomes coated with ice and his power supply shuts down. Tony is barely able to reactivate his thrusters in time to avoid crashing into the ground. Stark returns home, but the armor is so heavy that it crashes through three floors of the house.  As Tony recovers from his crash landing, he opens the box that Pepper left behind earlier. It's his original mini arc reactor, encased as a trophy with the message, "Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart."  Tony analyzes more data and decides to rebuild the suit using gold titanium from an old project to solve the icing problem. Tony also instructs Jarvis to add some "hot-rod red" paint to the next suit, codenamed Mark 3. Tony then leaves to attend his annual benefit dinner while the new suit is being assembled and painted.  At the charity event, Tony meets with Agent Coulson, who still wants to learn about Tony's incident. Tony then leaves to dance with Pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.  Tony is then confronted by Christine, the reporter from an earlier scene. She shows him photographs of his weapons being used by a terrorist group the previous day in the Middle East. Tony confronts Obadiah on the matter, and Obadiah reveals that he is the one who filed the injunction against Tony. Obadiah calls himself an "Iron Monger," and has no qualms about selling Stark Industries weapons to both sides of the conflict. Tony returns home, furious.  While he is at home, listening to news reports of the worsening situation in the Middle East, he tests modifications to his hand jets, turning them into a weapon. When the new suit is completed, Stark steps in and essentially transforms into Iron Man for the first time, determined to right his company's wrongs.  In a Middle East village, terrorists are rounding up civilians for capture & execution when they are confronted by a mysterious figure in red and gold. Iron Man has arrived. Within seconds, he defeats the first group of terrorists, using his advanced weapons to take out several without any innocent casualties. He leaves the group's leader alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.  While flying to find his weapons, Iron Man is shot down by a tank shell. Getting up, a second shell barely misses him. He responds by shooting a mini-missile at the tank, destroying it. He succeeds in destroying his missiles and taking out most of the terrorists.  During the fight, CENTCOM detects the unknown agent. Col. Rhodes is asked about the status of any new developments. He contacts Tony, who claims that he knows nothing about what is happening. In the meantime, Iron Man is confronted by two F-22's. He tries to outrun the jets but they are too much for him. Tony calls Rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the "unidentified craft." Rhody is furious about Tony sending in unauthorized equipment, and horrified when Tony explains that the "equipment" is actually himself! Iron Man is hit by one fighter jet, sending him flying into the wing of the second jet. The pilot is forced to eject, but the parachute fails to open. Iron Man, still under fire, manages to fly in and successfully deploy the parachute in time to save the pilot's life. Tony convinces Rhody to pass off what happened with the jets as a "training exercise."  As Tony arrives back at home, Pepper catches him removing the battle-damaged Iron Man armor.  Meanwhile, the Ten Rings terrorist group is visited by none other than Obadiah. It is revealed that Stane paid the Ten Rings members to kill Stark, but they realized who Stark was and demanded a much higher price. Obadiah takes the remnants of the Mark 1 armor they have gathered.  Tony tries to talk Pepper into helping him, believing that nothing else matters but stopping the people who he put in harm's way. Pepper is moved by Tony's dedication, and agrees. She goes into Obadiah's office with a tiny piece of equipment designed to copy files from the computer. As Pepper sifts through stored files, she finds a video from the terrorists proving that Obadiah was responsible for Tony's capture.  Obadiah comes into the office just as she is leaving, but Pepper manages to get away. However, as soon as he powers up the computer, Obadiah realizes what she was up to. On the way out, Pepper is joined by Agent Coulson and he agrees to help stop Obadiah with his fellow agents.  Obadiah meets with his team of developers working on his own armored suit. They have rebuilt the components, but they cannot re-create Stark's arc reactor. Stane is furious; then realizes that he has one other option.  Stane arrives at Tony's house and paralyzes him with a sonic weapon. Obadiah yanks out the power source from Tony's heart, taunting him all the while. After he leaves, Tony realizes that he has only one hope for survival - the preserved arc reactor that Pepper gave him in a display case. He gets the power source installed just as Rhody arrives.  Pepper, Coulson and several other agents arrive at Obadiah's research facility. They spot the Mark 1 Armor and a storage location where something else was kept. Just then, a gigantic robotic suit comes to life and attacks them - it's Obadiah's counterpart suit, code-named the Iron Monger.  Rhody watches Tony suit up, awestruck at the Iron Man costume. As Tony flies away, Rhody spots a new, silver-colored prototype suit... then shakes his head and mumbles "Next time."  Iron Man arrives and begins to fight Iron Monger. Jarvis warns Tony that he has only about half power in the suit; the older power source wasn't designed to work alongside the newer suit. The two ironclad warriors have a huge battle. Tony grabs the Iron Monger and climbs higher. Iron Monger struggles but before long begins to freeze up - his suit still has the same icing problem that Tony's other suit had. Iron Monger manages to escape from this, and Iron Man is now almost completely powerless.  Tony instructs Pepper to overload the building's arc reactor, which will generate a shockwave strong enough to knock out the Iron Monger's suit. Pepper is hesitant, believing that Tony could also be killed. Tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor. The reactor releases its shockwave, knocking out the Iron Monger, which falls into the reactor, killing Stane and destroying the reactor. Stark's original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing Tony to survive.  Days later, Rhody holds a press conference about the incident with the two robots. Tony is impressed with the newspapers coming up with the name "Iron Man," and plans to adopt it. Agent Coulson has released cover stories about Obadiah and the "truth" about Iron Man (who will be referred to as Stark's bodyguard). Pepper thanks Coulson but cannot remember the full name of the group he belongs to. Coulson just tells them to call it S.H.I.E.L.D. and states that they will be in touch again.  Tony goes before the reporters once more, and prepares to comply with the cover story. But, before he can even start, Tony Stark throws away his notes and declares "I am Iron Man." The press goes into a frenzy.  Much later (after the credits), Tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black telling him that as Iron Man, Tony has become part of a larger universe. Tony asks who the man is. He turns around and introduces himself- Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson). He's come to talk with Tony Stark about an upcoming project- known only as "The Avenger Initiative."

review/summary: Nothing New, Overrated, Disappointing
review/text: Perhaps I heard too much praise for this movie from others before I watched it, but it did not live up to my expectations.  While the action scenes were great, the rest of the movie was often slow. The ending action sequence was disappointing. It was action for the sake of action and didn't quite work. My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest. Talk about cheesy.  Robert Downey Jr was awesome. Jeff Bridges, until the end, which I already mentioned was very good too.  Terrance Howard's and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters could have been played by just about anyone. They both have talent but were not used effectively. Gwyneth was treated more like a Bond girl but one with no charisma. Terrance's character was bland. Gwyneth's was too cold and unapproachable. All she seemed to do was to walk around in tight dresses with big high heels. Boring. There was a glimmer of a good actress in there but as played, they could have substituted any model for her role.

review/summary: Iron Man is golden!
review/text: Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers. Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay. A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects.  The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore. While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story, lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.  Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation but it is darn close. It holds Downey's best performance in a long time. It is a fun, comic actioner that sure comes close to a "perfect film". I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Man of Irony
review/text: Morton Downy Jr. plays the lead in a film that transcends the comic genre. He portrays Tony Stark; the creator of Iron Man.  Tony inherited the legacy of his father's company; a weapons manufacturer.  All the core elements of the comic are there. Jarvis is a computer in this one.  Happy Hogan, the chauffeur.  Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts; IM's executive assistant.  Gweneth added dimension to what could have been a throwaway part.  Being his close confidant, she was privy to the issues that needed his attention.  The details of the original were all there.  Over forty years of continuity of didn't bog down this story.  Unlike Hulk, Spidey and X-Men, Iron man wasn't one of the more popular characters.  Being true to form, following the comics "Demon in a Bottle" tale, Tony has a drinking problem.  However, the movie deals with that aspect without turning the character into a joke. Fans of S. H. I. E. L. D.  take note.  There's a surprise in store for you if you watch the end of the credits.

review/text: If you've seen this movie, than you know that Marvel has done it again. Once again, yet another super hero breaks onto the scene in John Favereau's Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect fit for millionaire play-boy Tony Stark aka Iron Man. I thought this movie was great. The acting was good, the plot flowed smoothly, and the set up for a sequel was perfect. My only negative remark is that they should have gotten Tony and Pepper together. If you loved the movie as much as me, buy it! The price is great on Amazon.

review/summary: Robert Downey Jr. pulls it off!
review/text: I sat down to this one and cringed as I watched Robert Downey Jr, playing Tony Stark, start his comedy schtick (I knew that he would become "Iron Man").  But guess what . . . he pulled it off.  As Tony Stark (and Iron Man), Downey is quirky, consistent, and funny throughout.  Great presentation of the Iron Man.  Powerful, yet with vulnerablities.  And with the offbeat Downey Jr suited up inside - funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow was causing smoke to pour out of my TV.  A nice comeback by Jeff Bridges.  Super special effects.  Some violence etc, but no nudity or extreme profanity.  I would have no problem with a teen of mine watching this.  Fun movie. Be sure to watch the extra scenes (deletions/edits) on the DVD.  Good stuff.  And the ending leaves the door wide open for "Iron Man 2".

review/text: I didn't know a lot about Iron Man but I like action/adventure movies and decided to give it a try.  It totally blew me away.  The special effects were awesome and the plot was great.  Robert Downing Jr. was an excellent Tony Stark and I loved Gwenneth Paltrow's character.  All the acting was excellent and I'm really happy I bought this movie.  I'm really looking forward to the next one.

review/summary: This movie is fun
review/text: sound effects are expectedly (in this day and age) superb, the visuals are top notch, especially for a movie that involves a lot of "metal".  if I can nitpick, there was that scene where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) appears on a magazine cover (I think it was Newsweek) as he turned 21, and the magazine cover title says "Tony Stark Takes Reigns at 21".  It should be "reins".  I find it hard to believe Newsweek, even in a movie, would commit such misspelling.  I do have a problem with the reactor on Tony Stark's chest, though.  This is the one that requires suspension of disbelief.  Since it is right in the middle of his chest, what happened to his breastbone/sternum?  what keeps his ribcage up?  In his first test flight, he gets slammed into the wall, but shows no ill-effects. apparently, not even the reactor sitting between the upper and lower halves of his sternum gets rattled.  For all his genius, he cannot hack into Obadiah's computer and needs to send Pepper on a spying job.  For all their leading edge technology, Stark have no technology for removing shrapnel from a man's chest?  He gets shot down by a tank! If all tanks are that good at shooting flying objects, we'd have no need for separate anti-aircraft guns and missiles.  Ironically, in the next shot, the tank misses when Iron Man sidesteps the shot. Wow.  Filmmakers must hate the F-22 Raptor.  In both "Transformers" and this movie, the performance of the plane is rather disappointing.

review/summary: Great comic book movie!
review/text: What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations. There are some action scenes, but they don't attempt to mask or steal the show or moral of the movie (that weapons in the wrong hands can have devastating results). After realizing that his father's company was inadvertently leading to the destruction of lives, and after having a terrifying experience being held hostage in the Middle East, multimillionaire Tony Stark (Downey) changes his tune of his invention-making ways, saying that he will not create anything aimed at destruction again. However, some information of making the perfect destructive machine has leaked, and now it is in the wrong hands. Sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones who turn against you, and now Tony battles both sides of evil.  Although the film was two hours, it was a quick two hours because of the pacing of the film. There aren't crash scenes that drag on for long periods of time, and the plot and script were well-written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes. The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.  I would rank this film just a shade lower than Spiderman 2, but I think they are two of the best comic book movies out there in recent years.

review/summary: A Gem for both Comic Fans as well as the uninitiated!
review/text: One of the Best Comic genre movies to date, coming close to the caliber of the Dark Knight (which hails as the best comic book movie of all time).  I'm not a big Robert Downy, Jr. fan but he nails it in this movie.  His interpretation of Tony Stark is the nearly the best coupling of actor to a comic book character yet; certainly better than Eric Bano's Bruce Banner. He even gets closer to his character than Christian Bale (which I have to say is the best Bruce Wayne to date)--and almost as accurate as Ledger's Joker (who could get that close?).  Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect Pepper Potts, which, as this is a supporting role for her, points to her professionalism as one of the upper echelon of actors.  Of course, Jeff Bridges' performance is equally impressive.  The CG is impressive and not overdone.  The story is very well written staying true to the Iron Man mythos.  This is well worth your time and money.

review/summary: Thanks for not being Batman
review/text: Robert Downey, Jr. stars in the blockbuster movie Iron Man as Iron Man. His character is Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, inventor, playboy, and self-proclaimed Iron Man.  Iron Man is the perfect marriage of man, machine, and product placement. Despite all of the products placed in this movie, Iron Man is actually really good. The technology is crazy cool, action is on the money, and the story is tight. Verizon Wireless has the best deals on monthly plans.  I am happy that Iron Man did not go the Batman route. Every superhero movie since Batman Begins and The Dark Knight has to have a depressed and dark hero. Iron Man was funny and serious and action-packed all at the right times. Maybe Iron Man II: Cold Steel will have a much darker twist, like Tony discovers that he has agoraphobia and has to stay in his suit in all social situations.  The extras on the DVD are worth picking up the second disk DVD set. Actors, writers, and filmmakers alike can learn a lot of from Iron Man. You don't have to have huge explosions to get a point across. There was just as much action going on internally with Downey's character as there was action on the screen. The extras on the DVD highlight some of these points and can be used to learn something about great filmmaking and movie acting from Robert Downey, Jr., whose father is Robert Downey, Sr.  Published at www.NotHans.com/podcast

review/summary: Iron Man, Does Whatever An Iron Can
review/text: So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.  In this first and clever adaptation of "Iron Man" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as "the Jericho". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.  The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.  MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5

review/summary: Stunning in Blu Ray
review/text: This is one of the best movies to showcase HD capabilities.  I popped this in the Playstation 3, on a 61 inch Samsung DLP with a Denon soundbar and it was amazing.  The Iron Man suit looks like it is standing right in front of you.  I didn't know the suit had so much detail and movement until I watched it at home.  It looks better at home than it did in the theater.  The sound is superb.  You must watch this with the audio turned way up.  You can hear every blast and jet propulsion sound coming from the suit when Iron Man is flying.  My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.  Turn the volume way up and hear the surround sound go from one side of the room to the other as Iron Man and the jets fly by.  I love it.  Simply amazing.  One of the better movies in Blu Ray.  All the special features, BD live plus a digital copy to watch on your iPhone/iPod makes this a great deal!

review/summary: Better than Superman and Spidey 3
review/text: If you know the Iron Man comic, you know the story. Billionaire inventor and weapons producer Tony Stark is captured by renegade forces who want him to create a super-weapon for them. After requesting the supplies he'll need, Stark instead creates a metal suit for himself, using it to bust out of captivity. Now fully realizing the great havoc his weapons inflict, Stark vows to act as a protector of the human race and undo some of the damage his creations have caused.  I thought that this movie was good, but I was actually expecting it be a tad more spectacular. Maybe because I'd heard it being discussed in glowing terms for the better part of a year. It's hard to live up to such hype.  I thought Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job. Gwyneth Paltrow did a fair job for the role she had, but Pepper Potts didn't seem to be a very pivotal character in this film. I loved Terence Howard, and I'm disappointed about the rumors that he may be replaced in the next film in the series. Jeff Bridges chewed the scenery gloriously. (He looks very ominous without his hair!)  The effects were great, and I'm glad to see how the SpiderMan series and King Kong have cemented a new rule of thumb in hero/effects films (one started by Titanic, I think): even if the movie is all about effects, it will be better if you cast people who can actually ACT in the lead roles. (Not just models. Not just bodybuilders. ACTORS.) Everything will benefit from strong performances at the core of the film, even if you think audiences are really only coming to see you blow stuff up.

review/summary: Now THAT'S What I Call A Mech Suit!!!
review/text: IRON MAN is a total blast.  My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time.  Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.  In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...  All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.  There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for "truth, justice, and the American way."

review/summary: HD Home Theater (HDMI) w/Blu-ray brings IRONMAN Home (explained)
review/text: Experiencing IRONMAN in the theatre was breathtaking, unbelievable, and larger than life. A GREAT STORY. WELL TOLD.  Not since then have we been able to re-experience that magical event until NOW. Yes my fellow movie buffs this Blu-ray Hi-def Picture and Hi-def Sound now is in your home in the HD Home Theater (w/HDMI).  My qualifying statement:  My HD Home Theater weighs in at about $2000 plus movies.  A break down is; a Mitsubishi HD Projector (HC-1500) $800 (orig $1495), a Sony 5.1 Blu-ray Sound System (HT-SS2300) $399 (orig $499) and a Sony PLAYSTATION 3 w/Blu-ray player $399 (orig $499). Sony HDMI cables $150 and HD Screen Paint Kit $180 for my 108" viewing wall screen.  With this 1080p system I've created a HD Home Theater presentation sight and sound equal to an IMAX (on a smaller scale) experience.  The 1080p Blu-ray showing blows your minds eyes and ears, period.  This IRONMAN 2 Disc set is ALL HD and the Special Features (with over 3 hours of great stuff) covers every detail about the movie and the IRONMAN history from comic book to HD Movie.  Therefore no movie commentary is necessary! Totally awesome movie and background information.  A must have Blu-ray movie for your Sci-Fi Action Hero library.  Bottomline: Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark/IRONMAN.  Gweneth Palthrow is Pepper Potts!!  Get you'll watch it over and over.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent movie was more that I thought it would be
review/text: I was surprised to find that this was not just another formula super hero movie. Of course there were tremendous action scenes, and very evil villains, but the hero was different. The hero was intelligent. It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during "impossible situations". Also, although he starts out as a rebel with a bad streak, he experiences a major transformation and the audience gets to watch his character develop in a way that I found to be meaningful.  Although the movie dragged a bit at some points, it became so interesting that I wanted it to keep going. In fact, I'm really looking forward to the next Iron Man movie (the plot totally calls for it so I'd guess it will happen).  I would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint. Of course Gweneth Paltrow did an excellent job as well.  In conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie, particularly to those who enjoy intelligent characters, action, sci-fi and good vs. evil.

review/summary: A possible new fan
review/text: I'm a Batman girl myself, but if they continue to make Iron Man films as good as this one then I'll become a fan.  Robert Downey Jr. does a really good job in this film. His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them. He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer. He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.  But of course it's not. He's kidnapped and forced to build, and use, his own weapon against himself and his country. But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.  The special effects are really cool in this movie. They don't really look CGI or anything at all. They feel pretty real even though you know none of it is likely to be possible in say next year.  The movie flows along at a pretty good pace. It's rather short, but you don't notice it until the movie is done. I really like that it seems longer, but isn't.  The entire cast I felt was really good in this. The action was perfect, the imaginative weapons and gadgets on the suit were hot. The robots were even a life to themselves.  Super cool movie.

review/summary: He Was Turned To Steel...........
review/text: Actually...........he didn't turn to steel in a great magnetic field. Nor did he travel time for the future of mankind. Kind of like Spiderman I never really knew much about Iron Man. So.............I tried to watch this with an open mind. Ok, let's be brutally honest here. By the time I popped Iron Man into the DVD player I had just gotten home after being out with the co workers. Iron Man got popped into the DVD player and I plopped down on the couch, not just tipsy, not just a little woozy. I mean, fall off the couch TANKED!!! Vodka seems to affect how much I like movies. And how did I like Iron Man in my drunken stupor? I LOVED IT!!!! I'm not a big fan of Downey Jr. but  I'll be darned if he didn't do an excellent job. In the past I've been critical of overly long reviews and yet my most recent reviews should have been called novels instead. So...............I'll keep it short. What's good? The acting, the script, the FX of course. What's bad? Not much really. People may gripe about the negative Arab stereotyping and granted it is getting a tad old. But that minor little complaint aside Iron Man was a blast to watch. How many of you wanted to fly after watching this movie? I sure did, but I could barely make it off the couch to the bathroom so flying probably wouldn't have been the best idea at that particular moment anyway. Anyway.........Iron Man, loved it!!! A great way to spend an evening and yet another movie I wish I had taken the time to see in the theater. Vengeance from the grave, kills the people he once saved...............nobody wants him...............he just stares at the world. Love the movie, love the song........who the hell were Sabbath singing about anyway??? Iron Man doesn't seem to do anything the song talks about? Oh well......... Iron Man? Highly Recommended.  Iron Man lives agaaaaaaain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Iron Man Strikes Gold
review/text: I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.  Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.  Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.  The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.  And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.

review/summary: Best of the Comic Book Movies
review/text: We are a large family (9 of us), and all of us enjoy superhero movies. My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis. In other words, we know our comic book heroes.  Ironman far outshines all other comic-based movies to date. This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND...NO Cheese. I was hesitant when they cast Downey for the part- I am a huge fan, but felt he would not make a good Tony Stark. I was completely wrong- Downey IS Tony Stark. Flawless. The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best- ad lib. He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art. This movie would have been average without his comedic presence.  Paltrow ended up being a good choice as well. She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming. This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.  I have seen ALL of the comic based movies, as well as many of the animated straight to DVD as well. Mind you, there are many other good movies. Heath Ledger was INCREDIBLE as the Joker in the latest Batman movie. However, as an overall great comic-based movie, Ironman is going to be really hard to beat as my all-time favorite.  I hope there is an Ironman sequel in the planning, and hoping they do as good a job with the Avengers as they did with this one. MArvel has stepped it up a notch. Maybe this will push DC into giving us the Justice League movie we all know they're capable of????

review/summary: Simply Awesome!
review/text: We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.  The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?  Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.  He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her "the vacation is over" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.  The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close "friend."  This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy. We have seen it three times and something tells me we shall soon want to see it again, therefore, we highly recommend purchasing as opposed to going to the movies or renting it. Don't miss it... it is AWESOME!!!

review/summary: Tony Stark, the Man of Iron
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a>  One of the top 5 superhero films ever, right up there with "The Dark Knight", "Spider-Man 2", "X2: X-Men United", and "Superman Returns". You can really witness how much love Jon Favreau has for the source material. Robert Downey Jr. was an inspired choice to play Tony Stark, the billionaire superhero jerk with no superpowers, just a super brain that he uses to escape from terrorists. His company, Stark Industries, is a weapons manufacturer which he inherited from his father. After his escape, he changes his outlook on life and (much to the disappointment of some) the company. The film is well made, brilliantly paced, and has terrific performances throughout. The deleted scenes (from the DVD) were good choices to nix, because you can tell how they would have totally screwed up the flow of the film.  The two-disc collectors' edition does not disappoint. It is loaded up with special features, including deleted scenes (which thankfully, didn't make the final cut), trailers, and plenty of behind-the-scenes documentaries to keep you occupied.

review/text: This was a great movie. Awesome story, awesome acting, great special effects and who doesn't love a superhero?! This looked great on blu-ray. I did have a small issue with the movie slowing down on my ps3 but I think i've determined that its a hardware problem on my end, not any fault of the disc itself. I would still reccommend this even with my tiny slowing down problem.

review/summary: Solid, but could use a stronger heart
review/text: Iron Man is solid super-hero fare which employs the traditional themes, tropes and symbols.  It should prove satisfactory to a broad audience, but could have been so much more satisfying, probing, or insightful if it used more clever storytelling.  Other than the themes it introduces about the military-industrial complex and US foreign policy, it is the same superhero origin story you have seen many times.   Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges offer excellent performances.  Downey Jr. mixes cocky arrogance, critical humor, and a compelling transformation of a character who represents the worst aspects of the military-industry complex experiencing an inner conflict over the destruction that his inventions have caused.  Jeff Bridges was terrific, but the film used him to less effect than it could have.  At the onset, I thought Bridges only touched on his potential usefulness, which is when he plays someone who is operating at many levels, particularly as "the Dude" in The Big Lebowski, where he is always up to something, and nothing, all at once.  So at the beginning, I thought he might be up to more than just helping out Tony Stark; but, his character shifted from a helper to a plain-old greedy bad guy without the transformation that I think Jeff Bridges could have pulled off if the film gave him the time and context to do that.  Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing performance of a woman who sees beneath Stark's stark exterior and sees the man behind the jerk, and the suit.  The visuals, including Iron Man's heads-up displays and Tony Stark's computers and droids were fantastic.  The portrayal of the software underlying the hardware suit seemed to explain how this suit could actually work, and perhaps explains why this film could be made now instead of years ago - not only can digital rendering make a believable-looking suit for a movie, but the possibility of such a suit in today's world is itself more believable.  It's not a man in an iron suit, but a man with a multi-layered shell that is mediated through a software interface.  The film is aware of this, as Stark even comments on the newspaper's characterization of him as an iron man.  Nice touch.  Stark even suits up in a neoprene layer that would help to explain the buffer between him and the metal, as well as possible housings for the software - how the filmmakers missed the opportunity for an Under Armour product placement is beyond me!   The themes about US policy, weapons and industry lent an air of integrity to the film, but it seems those issues rapidly disappeared.  The irony, that Tony Stark becomes injured by the very weapons he manufactures, provides a great means to propel Stark toward his transformation.  The updating of the specific context from Vietnam (in the early comic books) to Afghanistan works very well, and shows that comic and superhero characters often reflect issues of their time and should be considered valuable forums for cultural dialogue.  However, the film seems less interested in those issues, and more interested in Stark's new suit.  It's unclear just what Stark's peace plan was, which means that although the film raises questions about responsibility and power (in both a personal, superhero sense and a national policy sense), it just leaves them behind to tackle the more personal issues and get the superhero flying around.  It could have also explored the theme of technological and human development, the boundary between machine and man, the exteriors we present to others compared with our inner needs and drives, etc.  Doing so would have made the film truly invincible, but unfortunately it just flies right on by those issues.  The biggest problem I had with the film, was that it was basically a two-hour origin story that followed, in the abstract, the same formula that every other superhero origin story follows.  Couldn't the writers have told us the origin story mixed in with a story progressing in the present?  I felt like I sat for two hours watching could have been a five or ten minute origin story.  Now that the film is over, I am ready to go see an Iron Man adventure!  In some ways, this is the problem with almost every super-hero movie - each new movie is just the same story with a new character, and then when it makes some money, the studio approves a sequel.  Two models that Iron Man could learn from are Star Wars and Speed Racer.  Part of why Star Wars (Episode IV) was so engaging is that Lucas explicitly left out the explanations - we were already caught up in an unfolding plot (he explains this in the audio commentary to the DVD releases that include the original film formats).  The opening sequence of Speed Racer manages to introduce the necessary origins at the same time it moves the current story forward.  Iron Man, however, is a movie about how another movie might yet come to be.  The filmmakers know this, and if you wait until after the credits, which for some reason I let the film run and caught this, you will see that they have one eye looking toward this future film.  Although Iron Man is a fun film that has some great visuals, conceptualizations, acting and political relevancy, I wondered why I had to sit through yet another origin story.  It is solid, though, and should please comic fans and general audiences.  Now that I've gotten the origin story out of the way, I look forward to the first of the Iron Man Adventures!  Format review:  The Blu-Ray disc that I watched has a nice special feature on the history of Iron Man, including interviews with Stan Lee and various other artists and writers who have worked on his stories.

review/text: I know a little bit about Blu-ray but I am not an expert on it, however, movies look much better if they are Blu-ray compared to upconverting DVDs. As for the movie, it combines all the elements of great comic books: smart, fun, plenty of action, and an intriguing story line; these movie elements are put into a cage together until they make babies, of these babies, only the aesthetically pleasing one is removed while the other chimera are put up for adoption or put to sleep. Iron Man is the baby they kept.

review/summary: He Who Flies With the Most Toys
review/text: The Good Things *Excellent video/sound quality.  There is some graininess to the picture, but it is still sharp, clear, colorful, and vivid. *Includes a vast number of great special features; 23 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, interviews, documentaries, stuff that explores Iron Man's suit, trailers, and a mock newscast by the Onion website. *Smashing special effects and action scenes. *Good, straightforward filming style. A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth. *Very good, sleek production designs and costumes. *Pretty good, straightforward story. Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance. *Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious). *Pretty good characters; pretty good acting. In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be. Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero. *Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again! *Great sound effects. *Awesome music.  The Bad Things *One or two slow parts. The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it. But it's still not too dull at all. *Some violence may be too much for young children (rated PG-13).  Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie. Much of the action and effects are quite memorable. The characters are not too shabby. The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening. Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing). It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."

review/summary: Iron Man
review/text: You I had heard many times this is an awesome movie, and I agree. When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen. The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges give stand out performances. I can't wait for the sequels. The DVD quality is excellent and the single disc played fine on DVD player and PC. The only extras are the deleted scenes on the single disc but then it was only $14.99 if you pre-ordered. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies. Great quality DVD with exceptional replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Batman Begins" and "Hellboy". Some super heroe sequels aren't as good on many of the super hero original movies and a couple were less than stellar on the first release, let's hope Iron Man sequels will be the exception.

review/summary: Downey is legendary in this role
review/text: I'm biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had.  The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though it's an FX driven film, it's not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said, the FX are INCREDIBLE.  The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT it's AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action.

review/text: It actually reminds me of the recently released "Transformers" remake. Iron Man isn't a new comic book hero. It is all updated to the current events. Gwyneth Paltrow and the villain Jeff Bridges put in very good performances that help make it less comic book like. Still the military and a lot of the action has dialog problems: sort of a cardboard/ comic book unreality, that you don't expect in a major studio release like this. I still like it.

review/summary: A Celluloid Heroic Fantasy That Excites And Makes A Statement To Hollywood And The World
review/text: I saw it yesterday afternoon.  I did something very bad. I should have known better being a comics head.  Ya never walk out before the credits are done.  Let's dispense with the minor caveats first. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was a little foppish. He did a great job otherwise, and I wasn't one of those whining about him being chosen for the role. Although if this were twenty years ago, you would have had to give the role to Tim Dalton or I would have called for a boycott. Despite the slight lack of seriousness in Downey's portrayal, I really can't imagine anyone else doing the role justice. He got to the heart of Tony Stark, the conflicted billionaire industrialist with an armored alter ego, even if I would have preferred Downey's Stark to be a little darker. Perhaps we'll get that in the sequel.  And the Iron Monger? I think I would have rather seen the Titanium Man or the Crimson Dynamo. Iron Monger didn't appear until way later in the comics and did himself in not long afterwards. However, Jeff Bridges was a fine choice, and held up his end well. If you weren't into the comics, you didn't see his double-cross coming. But when I heard the name "Obadiah Stane" (now I know how to pronounce it after 20 years), I thought "Uh-oh." Which brings me to what really got me into this movie. The foreshadowing...  There's a terrorist group called The Ten Rings. Hmmm...The Mandarin wears ten rings, one on each finger. James Rhodes eyes up a spare suit of armor. SHIELD is mentioned. Then there was that little cameo I missed...  The creative balance that was achieved also struck me. It's as if the makers were very mindful in creating a film with comics fans, casual moviegoers, and thinking viewers in mind. The changes made from the comics to the screen were necessary, otherwise it would have had to be a period piece and wouldn't have been nearly as relevant. In fact, my distaste for what has been done with Iron Man as of late in the comics, has been neutralized at least somewhat due to this movie. Redemption, in my mind, was one of this film's messages. The idea of war profiteering is addressed. Tony Stark, after surviving capture and seeing what his killing technology (apologies to Voivod), has wrought, decides he will not longer profit from manufacturing weapons. That plot point alone makes Iron Man a more timely superhero movie than any other I can think of.  Downey's protagonist and Bridge's antagonist aren't the only stars who shine. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts really captures the Girl Friday aspect of Potts' character as well as that of someone who's "just a friend" to a superstar guy. Terrence Howard's James Rhodes also impressed me as he came off as more than just a mere sidekick and straight man. Howard and Downey really had the "buddy mojo" working. You really believed that these two men from two totally different worlds and lifestyles could be the best of friends just as they are in the comics.  And of course the special effects were godly. The armor looked so real you felt as if you could touch it. Iron Man flew and ducked and dove like a half-man/half experimental aircraft. Yet, it didn't seem totally robotic either. The armor had an organic sense to it also, looking as human as a living weapon could without sacrificing the tech.  To tell the truth though, I could have done without the missles. Iron Man is not a tank. Repulsor rays are just more elegant, and they weren't neglected. But again, minor caveat. The fights were spectacular. When Iron Man and Iron Monger clashed, it was a cross between two knights battling for virtue and vice and two machines making war for the common good or ill of humankind.  So what we have here is an excellent heroic fantasy tale with a touch of James Bond, a swig of Golden Age cinematic romance, and a pro-peace message that takes more than a jab at the military/industrial complex. It's a film that I can effortlessly refer to anyone, lovers of comics and cinema alike. Although it may not have the emotion and drama that the Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, and Superman outings have had, I believe that Iron Man will go down over time as the most properly executed work in a genre that most filmmakers still have yet to grasp.  Respect the source material and the field in which the tales are originally told, and you will reap dividends, creatively and commercially. Let Iron Man be yet another lesson to Hollywood.

review/summary: Flawless
review/text: Absolutely flawless until the final 8 minutes where the CGI action was a tad too rushed, over-the-top, and phony-looking. But given it WAS the final 8 minutes and given the genius of the rest of the movie (look quickly and you'll see Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop about 2/3rds through the movie! What a little surprise among many!), the final 8 minutes are fully forgivable and can be considered just enough to allow a sequel (and/or The Avengers movie) to be even better.  For those who salivate over The Dark Knight, it was a great crime movie, but a mediocre superhero movie. Iron Man was a GREAT superhero movie. #1 on many people's all-time lists.  I, as many other reviewers I've read, despise Robert Downey, Jr., and Gwenyth anti-USA Paltrow in real life but they nailed the parts well, and like most of Angelina Jolie movies, they're better people in their movies than in real life. (Although Downey is far better in real life than he used to be, gotta give him a lot of credit.)  Just flawless really and we don't hesitate to forgive the final 8 mins of stilted CGI action!!!

review/text: The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role. He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.  This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.

review/summary: Very entertaining comic book movie.
review/text: While in the Middle East providing a new-product demonstration to the US Armed Forces, super-genius playboy weaponsmaker Tony Stark is ambushed and kidnapped. To buy his freedom from his captors he must construct the new weapon he was showcasing. He decides, instead, to build a suit made of iron to help him escape, a suit powered by an electromagnet that was installed in his chest to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart. Further design modifications and refinements lead Stark to a truly amazing concept which makes him a bonafide superhero.  The movie follows its hero (pun intended) on a series of personality changes. He goes from chick magnet to humble captive and from cocky fly boy to man on a mission. I am sure you can figure out which traits were more entertaining.  I was impressed at first with how much hype was created for this movie. Those involved took a pretty well-known but certainly less-popular comic book character and made it one of the most highly anticipated films in at least recent history. My hat is off to them all for going beyond that and delivering such a fun and energizing movie. They also followed the story well and included at least two teasers as to what we might see sometime into the future (*cough* War Machine and The Avengers *cough*).  The story gets in the way a few times, and it is cheesy comic book story, but I hope you can get past that. With the volume of comic books being adapted to film, most people should be pretty used to that by now. What that story does is form the environment in which the special effects can really shine.  Tony Stark is a stronger personality (and thus a better lead) than either Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, and Iron Man and the pace of his movie are also significantly more explosive. Since you're now questioning me, I will say that Iron Man was better than any of the Spider-Man movies. And I liked Iron Man for different reasons than Batman, so that is a hard comparison to make, but I think Batman Begins is still the better movie. And we'll see how Mr. Stark does against The Dark Knight later this summer.

review/summary: Finally, someone gets it right
review/text: Superhero movies are a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider-Man, Batman Begins), and sometimes they just go all weird for no reason (Superman Returns, The Hulk). "Iron Man" has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.  First, we go to a movie called "Iron Man" to SEE Iron Man, and director Favreau doesn't disappoint. We see him four times in the three different incarnations (original, plain iron, and the gold-and-red). The sequences are action-packed and perfect.  Second, Robert Downey Jr. is dead-on as Tony Stark. He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time. You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).  Finally, the storyline itself. It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new. You can tell Jon has had a lot of time with the comics by giving little nods to the real comic book fans out there (wondering about War Machine? There's a hint in the movie).  Perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling. You've got to sit through a LOT of them, but trust me: DON'T MOVE! The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.  I loved this film. I can't recommend it highly enough. I just hope they allow Jon to direct the next two AND the Avengers movie (if it ever comes out). Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider-Man in the first movie, Jon has Iron Man down pat.

review/summary: Downey's Best Performance Since Chapiln
review/text: Robert Downey, Jr. has proven again why Hollywood loves him so and Favrue has topped himself with a directorial effort that none could have expected.  A proven comedy director with his previous efforts, Favrue has crafted a piece of true magic that holds together brilliantly.  Not a love story like Spiderman, a tragic hero like Batman, Wolverine or the Hulk, nor a boy scout like Superman, Iron Man is something new to the film side of the genre--a hero who enjoys being a hero!  Yes, he seeks redemption. Yes, he is flawed. But this film lets the audience in on a new aspect. Heroism isn't all responsibility and secrecy. It can be fun and it can be more than comic relief, as in the case of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four franchise.  Aside from this, the special effects are awesome, the action is well executed and the Downey brings a joy to his performance rarely seen in a superhero film.  While Downey has done some excellent supporting roles in recent years, not since his legendary performance in Chaplin has Downey really shown what he can do.  So here's to Marvel, Downey and Favrue! Thanks for giving the superhero film something new, JOY!

review/summary: PS3 - how to make it work
review/text: I too experienced problems with the initial load problem.  I found that if you eject the disc (but don't remove it from the PS3) then turn off the unit - you can then turn it back on and it will load and play.  I discovered this quite by accident.  I was disappointed that I would have to wait for a new disc.  I tried cycling the power and discovered that it played.  I was able to see the movie, but I'll have to exchange the disc for a "fixed" one.  I wonder how the BD-Live content will be once I'm able to view it?  The graphics/composition of the menus is very cool - the best I've seen in a sci-fi disc.  -  Cheers & Good luck, Brian

review/summary: Horrible; best scenes cut and labeled 'extended/deleted'
review/text: Some the best and in-depth story-telling scenes are not in the main feature film. Even worse the opening scene is cut short as well. The thing about the film segment is the tail end of its is used in a separate scene later (i.e. even you went to the trouble of making your own cut you couldn't just slap it in). What is wrong with people today? You might as well record this from television on the next opportunity and edit out the commercials! The only saving grace is the second DVD with features on the making of the film.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: Jon Favreau delivers an awesome movie! A good comic book transition. Not bad for an actor.  Jon Favreau updated the Iron Man mythology to the Iraqi War from Vietnam which makes better sense than trying to complete a period piece. The basic plot points are the same from the comic book.  Tony Stark ironically gets injured from his own weapons and is saved by Youren, his cell mate in Afghanistan. Arab mercenaries have captured Stark and force him to build the Jericho, his ultimate weapon. Of course, he builds the Iron Man suit to fight them off and get away. Back in Malibu, California, Tony shuts down the weapons manufacture section of Stark Industries and works on perfecting the Iron Man suit. Meanwhile, his dad's friend and Tony's mentor, Obadiah Stern, goes nuts and tries to take over the company (of course). He steals the technology that keeps Stark alive and uses it to power his own Iron Man-like suit to reek havoc all over L.A. Of course Iron Man gets up and fights him off. Everyone lives happily ever after and he reveals himself to be Iron Man.  Agent Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D. helps Pepper Potts save Tony and assists in destroying Obadiah. Agent Coulson wanted to debrief Tony on how he escaped Afghanistan, but he never got his chance. He sets up a future appointment with Pepper Potts and exits. Nick Fury makes a post-credits appearance and tells Tony that he isn't the only superhero in the world, and tells him that he wants to talk to him about the "Avengers Initiative". Sets up future events for Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and of course the Avengers.  If you're going to see or have already seen the Avengers (2012), it's best if you watch Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man and Iron Man 2. It's not needed but it will make sense of things described in the plot of the Avengers.

review/text: I really did not think that I would like this movie. It appeared, from the previews to be pro-war, and frankly, this turned me off. The content, however, was anything but what I assumed. I do have some gripes about the amalgamation of stereotypes though. Admittedly, the Arabic was spoken nice and slowly, and was relatively keeping with what the translations said. Still, I don't expect much from Hollywood when it comes to not perpetuating negative stereotypes.

review/summary: The Man of Iron!
review/text: 4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece  Slam bang, rip roaring, old school comic book hero movie, that's "Iron Man! The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.  Robert Downey Jr. is "Iron Man," he may be the brightest acting star of his generation, as he can play almost any part, & he plays the wealthy industrialist, swashbuckling, chick magnet, Tony Stark to perfection, with a wink of his eye! Jeff Bridges, who is also one of the greatest actors of his generation, plays the double dealing, money hungry, evil surrogate father figure, Obadiah Stane, of Tony Stark, with malicious glee, as he plans to take Tony's inventions & sell them to both sides of the fence. Tony's personal aid/secretary, Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is perfect in her role as the faithful secretary, that is thinly disguises that she is in love with her boss. She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence. These three actors make "Iron Man," sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!  Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!

The story and character build is one that keeps the viewer interested quite apart from any "superhero" quality.  It is not as far fetched as the imagination would recommend rather quite feasible in technoloy although some of the action takes it further than a rational story.  actors/actresses are well cast for the most part.

review/text: Not a bad film overall. The action is pretty consistant throughout.  Although Iron Man finding his inner self through adversity was a little corney.  The fact that such a brilliant persona counldn't see what was going on under his very nose was probably the crucial element for me.  It appeared to mimic what really does go on for some of these people in the real world.  So wrapped up in either their work or themselves they can't see the forest for the trees.  Overall, acting reasonable, reflection on truth, very close.  A good action flick.

review/summary: Iron Man Arrives
review/text: Got the "Iron Man" DVD on 6 Dec in a well packaged box with two others. It arrived but not as swiftly as I have gotten from other sources. But I have no complaints, it arrived on the due date and not damaged. The copy I got is the widescreen version, which I prefer - I have gotten some that didn't show whether it was full or widescreen format. I hate those kinds of surprises. I love the movie, but then, I am a fan of this type movie; Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Iron Man, et al. I really didn't care for Robert Downey's movies before this one but I must say I really do like his rendition of Tony Stark, playboy ba-zillionaire, weapons inventor, manufacturer and now superhero. I am one of Gwyneth Paltrow's fans too. I believe she did an outstanding job in the supporting role as his secretary/confidant/almost love interest. Mr. Bridges makes a very good bad guy. I hadn't seen him as such before. He really garnered my wrath as he went about fattening his bank account at the expense of the world, as it were. Good job, Jeff. There are really 2 evil villains in this flick. The muslim fanatic and one that I never thought of until close to the end - Jeff Bridges. I really get off when the bad guys (2 of them in 2 different scenes) get their "come-uppance".  Being a retired Soldier who served from Vietnam into OIF and Afghanistan, I have no love lost for villains who deliberately destroy people and their lives to gain control over others for the villains' own benefit. But, back to the movie. The photography and computer generated flying sequence with the 2 USAF fighters is really good, in my humble opinion.  And, as in some other movies, there is a short piece after the credits have rolled that left the door open for Iron Man II.  I am looking forward to it, I believe it is to be released in late spring to early summer. Anticipation.

review/summary: Iron Man has it all - acting, story, effects, humour and drama
review/text: I'm very glad that Robert Downey, Jr got his act together. It is largely because he did that we have this film. He holds it on his shoulders ably. Like other comic book based movies, I don't care about the source material at all. The only question : Is the movie entertaining - yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.  This movie is a master class in acting from Robert - whether that be comic or dramatic. What other lead actor could play Tony Stark? Granted, that is an easy question, as there are not that many real 'actors' out there at the moment. The reason I say this is that Robert has to play an unsympathetic yet occasionally charming and intelligent man. This in itself is a challenge - which he rises to admirably. People have to work with him, but they don't have to like him - in fact, that does lead to problems for the character. Of course the supporting cast are right there with him - at or near his ability level.  The last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie. The last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically - it is the only possible culmination in the film's world. You are left hanging on with a sense of anticipation, yet you laugh as well.  Perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.  If I could add one thing to this Blu-Ray set, it would be a commentary by the director and stars. Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Great special effects, pretty typical story
review/text: There are two classes of superhero films:  top tier ones that are psychologically real (Spiderman, X-Men) or simple two-dimensional stereotypes.  Iron Man, alas, is the latter, at least for me:  they tend to over-emphasize special effects to make up for weaknesses in the script, have far more action than character development, and follow some pretty simple formulas.  I was hoping for better.  That being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.  Perhaps it is that he is such a playboy genius type that turned me off, as opposed to a nerd like Peter Parker, who unexpectedly gains power.  I didn't identify with him much.  But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.  Bridges isn't a bad bad guy, but he is lackluster.  I did like the special effects and technology evocations.  When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.  His end fight is also very fun indeed, particularly as he is handicapped.  Recommended with these caveats.

review/summary: No end of fun...
review/text: The always entertaining Mr. Downey is on hand to present his tongue-in-cheek interpretation of the "super-hero". I've always been a fan of his, and with the help of director Jon Favreau (a fine actor in his own right) the two create a silly, never boring film of complete entertainment. It would be silly to try to say anything that hasn't already been said, but I rented the single-disc version; I'd been buying too many films, sight-unseen. This is one I'd buy, and that's about the best recommendation I could give!  Haven't heard much about Ms. Paltrow lately, but she's quite fine and confident in an important role. Jeff Bridges, too, always Mr. Nice guy in every film he's made, but here he shows surprising variation. As I said, everything's been blabbed away by previous reviewers, but I was amused and entertained a whole lot. There WILL be subsequent episodes, and I look forward to them. I just hope it doesn't dissolve in Hollywood garbage like other super-hero franchises...

review/text: Has anyone realized that the DVD version has many missing parts to it?  In the theatre, just in the beginning alone for example, where is the part where the blonde interviews Starke before they end up in bed together?  What about the Casino part where he completely doesn't show for his award?  What about all the witty commentary btwn Starke and the army squad driver/passengers??  I understand that there are deleted/extended scenes included on the DVD, BUT, I thought those were scenes that were extras that were never part of the original movie.  Am I wrong in this??????  ALSO, even some of the deleted scenes were cut!  So some of the movie that I saw in the theatre just plain doesn't even EXIST on the DVD!  Is it a different story on the double disk edition or blue ray version??  They all claim to be a 125 minute play time so what the heck??  Someone enlighten me b/c I LOVED this movie in the theatre and I am very disappointed that I don't get the full version on my DVD!

review/summary: Terrific and original, for a while
review/text: Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er-do well scion of a weapons manufacturer. He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course. One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.  Downey is perfect for the job. His dry acting style and bad-boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard-driving protagonist. He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand. Gwyneth Paltrow trots out her American accent to play Stark's all-knowing assistant. Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations. The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test-piloting his new equipment. A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.  Iron Man does a lot (mostly thanks to Downey) with borrowed materials. There's a know-all female assistant (a la 007's Moneypenny), a technical wunderkind (a la Batman) and foreign bad guys (a la Vin Diesel). Still, the film is rocket-solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle. There's never a question of who will win, and it would have been refreshing if the plot had allowed for fewer explosions, close calls and destroyed cityscapes.  A quickie, surprise ending would have been better than the 20-minute, predictable mini-Armageddon that threatened to drop this review to 3 stars.  A fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.

review/text: This is certainly better than the latest Hulk movie, but for me it never quite reached the heights that I had hoped. The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen. In particular where he was initially testing out its flying ability adjacent to his collection of classic cars. Great scene...  Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again. Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.  Where the film went downhill was the final 1/4. Much like the ending of the latest Hulk film the final battle was entirely predictable. Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.  My review is perhaps a reflection of my age. If this film had been produced when I first read the comics (the 1970's) I would have been blown away by it. Sadly age and a somewhat more cynical view of life means that superheroes are never quite what they were. I still love the comics though!

review/summary: Pretty good comic book adaptation.
review/text: It is also updated for our time with events fictionalized from Afganistan, the villans being terrorist, foreign & domestic. Broad enough to spawn endless sequels. Sort of like the James Bond franchise. One problem, however good James Bond is or was, Sean Connery was the best Bond. Vodka martini references aside there are some simularities between  Bond & Robert Downey's Tony Stark (Ironman). He is the best thing about this movie. Let's not forget Gwynth Paltrow as Pepper, his friend assistant & girl everything. She is absolutely fabulous. I can't see either of these gifted actors wasting their careers on too many  Ironmans. It is after all a cartoon.   Tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else & heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire. His ego is as big as his fortune but everybody loves him. He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist. While in captivity he builds Ironman & long story short, escapes. He returns home a changed man & has a revelation to change the world. He creates another better Ironman to destroy all the weapons of destruction his company has sold to the world. This is not taken well by partners & others that profit from this military industrial complex. At this point the movie just breaks down into foolishness & mayhem. I reccommend this movie. It's good fun

review/summary: Fun movie.
review/text: Iron Man (Jon Favreau, 2008)  Wait, Jon Favreau directed this? The guy who did Elf? And Zathura? Someone must have messed up the credits, because I find it well-nigh impossible to believe that someone who could have unleashed those monstrosities on the world could make not only a credible, but an exceptionally enjoyable, action thriller. And yet here it is, in all its glory, Iron Man.  Robert Downey, Jr. is one of those guys who pops up in movies when he's out of rehab and either wipes the floor with the entire rest of the cast (Chaplin, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) or kind of fades into the woodwork (Gothika, a movie I'm sure everyone involved would love to forget). This is a mopping-the-floor performance, which is even more impressive given the caliber of the rest of the cast; Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Favreau himself all turn in good performances, but nothing on this screen at any time can touch Downey, who plays a much friendlier and more naïve Tony Stark than I've been used to seeing in comics recently. (Interesting that The Dark Knight and the upcoming Watchmen are all about making the superheroes more human and gritty, while Iron Man wants to get back to almost golden-era-comics-like exaggeration and strong lines between the good guys and the bad guys.) As a result, the bad guys come off as even more evil, and in the opening scenes this could easily have been played in a ham-handed-racist sort of way. I don't doubt there are those who will take that interpretation away from the first half-hour of this movie, in fact, but to me it came off more like Three Kings; the terrorist-as-bad-guy approach is topical, rather than racially-based, and you could have stuck in any nationality. In other words, it's not about the Arabs.  This is a fun movie, very well-done all around. It has the unfortunate distinction of being released in the same year as The Dark Knight, which is likely to eclipse every other superhero movie released in 2008, but it's such an entirely different film in tone that the two make very good foils for one another. Quite enjoyable, and well worth your time. ****

review/summary: Iron Man = FUN
review/text: This movie is lean, solid entertainment. It wastes no time, is well paced and smartly written with snappy dialogue and good subtext. The action delivers the goods, but not at the expense of story or character.    Most importantly, this movie is FUN! Robert Downey Jr. is a one man party onscreen - funny, smart and compelling to watch throughout. It seems as though he's having more fun than should be legal ( I know, don't tempt him).    The effects are breathtaking, seamlessly switching from practical to cg without calling attention to artifice - a major feat these days. All the gadgetry seemed plausible somehow and delivered ( for me at least ) a sense of giddy wish fulfillment - I totally bought that this guy could fly around in a high tech suit of armor.    Gwyneth Paltrow is a pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was ambivalent about her, but here she's great, and mines a layer of vulnerability in her character that could have easily been unrealized by lesser talent. Oh, and did I mention that she looks really HOT?!?! She looks really HOT!    Terrence Howard is good as the straight man and there were a couple male-bonding scenes with Downey Jr. that rang as being particularly genuine.    Jeff Bridges ( always a pleasure ) does a great job of taking his character from ambiguous manipulator to outright villain without any breaks in logic or motivation.    The movie balances humor, drama and action with a light tone while still managing a fairly serious subtext about war profiteering and global violence.    It all adds up to one of the most entertaining popcorn flicks around and a serious contender for 'best superhero movie' award. A better time at the movies is hard to find.

review/summary: Iron Man, Iron clad fun!
review/text: Whereas I did read the occasional IronMan comic and Avengers mag all the time, I wasn't sure what to expect on the screen.  With so many comic book superhero films, you don't know which era the producers will choose over the other.  Beings as many artists have penned Iron man over the years.  I think the writers did a good job of taking the best of IM and play a bit with his origin, but it worked mostly.  It wasn't predictable in that he had to perfect his suit and test it, all the time thinking he was sure of himself, and there lies the comedy of the repeated failed attempts before he came close to perfecting the flying/weapons aspects. I was never bored watching it in the theater, and when it was over wanted to see it again! I look forward to it's dvd release and any morsel of extras it comes with!  Wonder what the 2 disc ed. will have?  I hope it's the recent ripoff digital copy for pc loading!  I want extras!  Thank god the studios are still making standard dvd's and haven't totally switched to Bluray!  Tired of the format wars, laser,CDI, Beta, vhs, dvd, HD, Bluray..when will it end?!  I bought HD and love it, and now 2 formats for dvd is quite enough for now.  I look forward to IM 2!

review/summary: An entertainining movie, especially for the pulsating action sequences & witty dialogue!
review/text: Frankly, I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr., playing a superhero. This probably had to do with the initial impression I had from what I had read so much about him - faltering years as a drug addict & jail bird in real life.  I last saw him as the conniving Dr Kovak in 'The Shaggy Dog', & also as the rogue special agent, John Royce, opposite the characters of Tommy Lee Jones & Wesney Snipes in the thriller action movie, 'US Marshalls', on cable television.  With the last movie, 'The Forbidden Kingdom', in the same movie theatre, my gym buddy & I saw a brief trailer of 'Iron Man', which had sort of piqued our personal interest.  Yesterday, my gym buddy & decided to go for a movie in the late afternoon, & we chose 'Iron Man' at Jurong Point.  In a nut shell, 'Iron Man' was more of a CGI-boosted special effects extravaganza. I read from the papers that the movie costed US$165 million to make.  The movie was based on a superhero character from Marvel Comics, creators of 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men'.  Story-wise, it had a relatively simple plot.  Robert Downey Jr., played Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist & also an inventor extraordinaire in designing & building high tech weaponry of mass destruction for the US Army.  His company was known as Stark Industries, founded by his late father, Howard Stark, who was involved with the Manhattan Project.  While traveling in Afghanistan on a business trip, his convoy was ambushed in a war zone - he was injured, ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets - & was kidnapped by a group of militants, headed by a lunatic who wanted to control the entire Middle East.  Kept alive by a make-shift electro-magnet embedded above his heart, apparently designed to prevent the shrapnel from puncturing his heart, Tony was forced by his captors to build a missile with metal scraps & electronic leftovers in a cave-enclosed prison.  Instead our hero, with his usual cool arrogance & drawing on his inventive genius, hatched an escape plan revolving around a crude metallic armoured suit -the advent of the prototype, 'Iron Man'.  Of course, he managed to escape - with the electro-magnet over his heart intact - & eventually returned to America, seemingly a changed man after seeing the death & destruction caused by his company's weapons.  With that, he decided arbitrarily that Stark Industries would stop producing military weapons, much to the chagrin of his mentor & associate, Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges), who somehow had other sneaky ideas of his own.  Meanwhile, Tony began experimenting with the electro-magnet imbedded over his heart & exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor - apparently a power-yielding generator that could emit enough juice to keep his heart shrapnel-free, & at the same time, could provide adequate power to a new armoured suit he had in mind.  So, while our hero was cranking his new armoured suit, Stane was secretly conniving with the militants in Afghanistan, who apparently had managed to salvage the original work plans of the armoured suit built in the cave during Tony's captivity.  It was during this movie segment that I realised that Tony's unfortunate ambush in Afghanistan was all the while being set up by Stane in a futile attempt to take over Stack Industries.  With the original work plans secured from Afghanistan, Stane managed to assemble a team of specialists to build a modified version of the metallic armoured suit, nicknamed 'Iron Monger'.  The remaining segment of the movie - in fact, for all the excitement we were waiting for - displayed the power struggle between Tony & Stane, eventually culminating into a violent clash - with CGI special effects, of course - between the two heavy metal behemoths, 'Iron Man' & 'Iron Monger'.  [We must accord our thanks to the ingenuity & inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios.]  If you have the opportunity to watch the sci-fi action movie, 'Transformers', you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans & vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork.  When compared with 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men', I had this notion that 'Iron Man' was more like a slapstick comedy to me.  The two actresses, one playing Tony's Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) & the perky television reporter, were primarily eye candies. I reckon they were there just to show Tony's flamboyance.  In fact, the most fascinating gadget in the movie, to me at least, was the flash-drive-sized sonic paralysis emitter, which Stane used to harmlessly knock out his opponents. I would love to have one of that.  Did I enjoy watching the movie at the end? I sure did. Was it entertaining? Yes, especially the action sequences & witty dialogue. Was it worth spending the two hours in the movie theatre? Yes. My gym buddy felt likewise.  At least, I now have a different impression about Robert Downey Jr.

Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).  The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.  State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)  Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?  Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage! Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!

review/summary: A Superhero Epic with Wit, Heart, True Political Relevance and Downey's Knowing Work
review/text: Casting Robert Downey Jr. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011680">Chaplin</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCZGV8">Zodiac</a>) in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE">Elf</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>) has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.  The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim ("Rhodey") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.  With impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH">Spider-Man</a>. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.

review/summary: Like the Tin Man, Iron Man Lacked Heart
review/text: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.  On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?  The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.  Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.  The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.  Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.  To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie.

review/summary: W-O-W....
review/text: Before I say anything, I have to say that I reluctantly saw this film. I was mildly curious about it (especially considering it's RD Jr's first big film in a while), but not really enough to want to pay to see it in the theaters. However, my father wanted to see it & I went. Boy was I glad that I did.  The movie starts off with an action scene as well as a  bit of an info dump about Tony Stark for the newcomers like me. It doesn't last too overly long, so as not to bore the fans who are well versed in the lore of Iron Man. From there the movie can honestly be divided into three parts. The first concerns Stark's time as a prisoner of war and how he frees himself with the help of another prisoner (the birth of the first suit). The second concerns Stark's improvements of the suit as well as on the technology that is keeping him alive & how Stark tests out the suit. This is easily the most light hearted and thrilling part of the movie. The third is when Stark begins to discover who is behind the sale of his weapons to terrorists & the final showdown with the big baddie. All of these parts flow seamlessly into each other and overall the film is very cohesive. The ending had to have been one of the most awesome I've ever seen, although I must admit that I missed the bonus at the end of Nick Fury (I had to look for it on the net to see it afterwards).  The acting was all first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed that the director & crew decided to bring out Paltrow's natural beauty rather than slather her face with makeup. It really lent an edge of "realism" to her character. The soundtrack was also incredibly good and it all fit the movie well. All in all, I'd give this film a 5/5. It deserves it. I may rate it lower after rewatching it at home, but at the moment I have to say that I really enjoyed it.

review/summary: 4 1/2! Another great Marvel production
review/text: "Iron Man" Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Directed by Jon Favreau  Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is head of the extremely successful weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. Tony heads to Afghanistan for a demonstration of his latest creation. Unfortunately on the return trip Stark's military convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive. His captors demand that he build a missile for them. Tony discovers much to his dismay, that the militia that has captured him is well armed with weapons from none other Stark Industries. His former cavalier attitude about his weapons changes and he decides to move his company into a different direction but first he has to create his means of escape...  This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. I can't speak for the die hard Ironman fans about how true the movie is to the comics (I was always a Wolverine Fan) but I think overall the story was well told and well thought out.  The Good: I was a little bit skeptical at first but Robert Downey Jr. actually portrayed the Tony Stark Character very well. The movie overall was well cast. I think Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for her role as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges (formerly the Dude) was very convincing in his role as Obidiah Stane. As always look for Stan Lee to make a cameo but this time he actually plays a known person and it was pretty funny even though very brief.  The special effects and action sequences didn't disappoint. The flight sequences were all very fast paced and had good intensity. The suit was very well done and stayed true to the comics from what I've seen.  The sound track was also good with tracks from A/C D/C, Black Sabeth and Suicidal tendencies.  The Bad: For me nothing. As I said if you are a die hard fan you won't be able to help yourself at picking apart any inaccuracies from the comic to movie translation. There was a little bit of shamless Audi product placement but that is to be expected.  Overall: This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. If you are interested in comic based movies got out and see "Ironman"!

review/summary: Brainless and borderline nonsensical, but still an enjoyable slice of hokum
review/text: Given all the praise and excitement surrounding The Dark Knight, the superhero movie Iron Man released just a few weeks earlier was somewhat overshadowed. However, reviews of Iron Man were almost universally positive at the time, so I was looking forward to sitting down and enjoying the movie.  The resurgent Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a hyper-rich genius engineer and unstoppable womaniser who builds extremely lethal weapons for the US military. His latest invention is a massive multi-warhead variation on the 'bunker-buster' missile, one that is meant to level entire Afghan mountain ranges. Stark is kidnapped by stereotypical Afghan terrorists during a demonstration of his new weapon and forced to build them some newer and more lethal versions of the same weapon. Stark is aided in his work by a gentle local educated Afghan man who is brought in as a translator but in the space of about ten minutes has convinced Stark that making massive destructive weapons isn't good for his soul and he needs to change. Stark, despite being under constant 24-hour video surveillance, is able to build a massive robot suit armed with flamethrowers and a jetpack instead of the promised missile, and is able to effect an escape, although sadly not to the theme tune from The A-Team.  Having checked that I hadn't made an error and picked up a copy of a comedy movie by accident, I continued watching in mounting disbelief as Stark returns to the USA as a new, more moral man, deeply changed by his horrifying experiences in the Afghan mountains. The newer, more caring Stark decides to build a more uber version of his metal suit so he can personally go off and slaughter the terrorists with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. Of course, hijinks ensue and the story ends in a series of massive explosions. Who would have thought?  Iron Man is a deeply stupid movie with plot holes and logical flaws so vast they render the story almost nonsensical in places. However, the movie remains brainlessly entertaining thanks to the almost single-handed efforts of Robert Downey Jr., who was clearly enjoying himself far too much making this hokum. His portrayal of Stark works excellently, despite the highly dubious writing, and I suspect his best moments were all ad-libbed. Suffice to say, without its star working above and beyond the call of duty, this movie would be a total failure. Gwyneth Paltrow stands around being, well, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges manfully deals with a curious baldness-beard combination. There's also a lot of guff about a new energy source Stark spontaneously created in his Afghan cave that dozens of the finest scientists in the world cannot replicate in their state-of-the-art labs, but none of it really matters.  Iron Man (***) is quite possibly the most sloppily-written film I've seen since Pearl Harbour, but it's also a lot of fun, as long as you strictly remember to put your brain in neutral before watching it.

review/summary: "I am Iron Man."
review/text: Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.  Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly "summer popcorn action flick", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.  My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.  I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.  8.5/10

review/summary: Excellent action film for the whole family!
review/text: I watched this movie a few nights ago with my teenage son and really enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Spark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an "Iron Man suit", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool.  Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man.  Great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars. Good humor too. I love the suits, I love his cars, and I thought it all really well done.  We often have a tough time finding suitable family movies without tons of sex and profanity. This was great!

review/summary: A good dramatic and sometimes humorous film
review/text: This film, based on a comic book character, is very well acted and is filled with no stop action and suspense. A very rich, eccentric, smart, and generous owner of a weapons company, Tony Stark, is captured by Moslem terrorists. They say that they want him to develop a weapon for them. But is this the real reason that he was captured? Who is behind the capture?   Tony builds an iron suit of armor with built-in flame-throwers and rocket launchers and an ability to fly. Using the suit, he destroys the terrorists and returns to the US determined to give up weapon production and use his genius to help people. He builds an improved suit of armor despite suffering many humorous failures. He uses the suit to fly to the Moslem country where he saves people from the terrorists.   Meanwhile the terrorists found and reconstructed the discarded first iron suit. Tony's number two man in the weapons company meets with the terrorists, finds out about the iron suit, and builds an improved version of his own. There is a final battle scene between two iron men and Tony needs to decide if he wants to reveal to the public that he is the iron man.

review/summary: Astounding Creativity
review/text: What would you do if you were a weapons developer; find out that the weapons you manufacture are used to kill innocents and then learn that you have shrapnel near your heart that could kill you at any moment?  If you are anything like Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) you'd build a mechanical suit and fight to end your own weapons. And, to prevent your death, you'd create this little gizmo based on a new energy source to prevent the shrapnel from entering your heart. It's this energy that powers your suit.  But of course, the bad guys don't want you to succeed, so they'll build a gigantic robot to stop you.  This movie is packed with fabulous actors: Downey, Paltrow, Bridges, Howard, and Paul Bettany as the voice for Stark's butler, Jarvis.  I think this film is better than the Spider-man movies and just up there with Batman Begins. Everything about it is top-notch: acting, writing, chemistry, etc... Some of the best comedic moments are between Tony Stark and his robot assistance as he builds his updated Iron Man suit.  The bottom line for my experience of this movie was creativity. The creativity found in this movie was astounding. Everything is crisp and great looking.  This is going to join my DVD collection. Can't wait for the sequel!

review/summary: On the same level as Batman Begins, and that's saying something
review/text: Iron Man is just a flat out fantastic comic book to film adaptation. I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way. Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.  My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times. While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe. Now bring on the Iron Man 2!

An excellent rendition of a comicbook with a surprisingly good performance by Robert Downey Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow was, of course, superlative, and Jeff Bridges was unexpectedly good as a villain.  It would be easy to wax poetical about sins and redemption, friendships, betrayal, a man unable to cope with a good woman and drowning his sorrows with less worthy ones, etc, but I'll leave that for the freshman English students.  It was a rollicking good action flick.  Flying armor suits, bad guys you can really hate, cliff-hanging escapes from life threatening situations,a good guy who becomes more loveable than he starts out, chases, shoot-outs, a sidekick with more style than brains (what one would expect from a fighter-jock) and a beautiful love interest.  Yup, blocks are all checked.  All of this executed very competently, and well acted.  If only they had been a little more discrete with product placement.  The Bulgari watch was very emblematic of this.  Like the watch, the movie had an excellent mechanism in terms of plot and production values.  Like the watch, the brand names were more than a little bit over-done.  Still, the movie was very enjoyable.  E.M. Van Court

review/text: I have been a comic book fan but never been an Ironman fan. Basically I like the Mr. Miracle, Spiderman type of Super hero.  But this movie is very well made. I am not a Robert Connick Jr fan neither but this has to be his best performance yet. He brings a sense of humor to a character that I did not think had a sense of humor. Unlike other films of these gender the producers tried to make this a believable film like the Japanese Summari Movies. It is still hard to believe that a human in a titanium suit can fly and be more agile than any gymnastic athlete. but then who knows what the future will bring.

review/summary: Iron Man Rocks!
review/text: Iron Man is one of the best damn movies to come out this year. I was very pleased that they stayed so closely with character and also glad that Tom Cruise did not get the part. Reason being that Robert Downey Jr. was selected for the part was that in his life he had alcohol and substance abuse and character Tony Stark had basically the same thing. He brought this remarkable character to life and I can't wait for the sequel in two years. In this movie you will find all that you want to find in a movie, action, adventure, drama, romance, and comedy. This movie is definitely going to be a keeper in my books, but in overall to everybody, get this movie!

review/summary: BETTER THEN I THOUGHT...
review/text: By now - the crazed fandom crowd has hit the theatre too take in the spectical that is Iron Man.Saw the second showing @ a local movie-with some one who had no interest in it at all.Guess what that person came out liking the attude and the who done it asspect of the movie.Me well Iron Man always wasone of my fav-marvel heros-but I enjoyed it more then I thought i whould.For Marvel Hero movies this is up there with Spidy1-but doesn't match DC's Batman Begins.So4.5 for this one.   Tony Stark a mulity billionaire war-monger-who see's the light or error of his ways when he is taken hostage by power crazed nomadic rebels.He is nearly killed by one of his own bombs-his life is saved by a local doctor of sorts...with the aid of a battery operated device and geltin substance too contain the shrapnel.By now he is beging too see just what his weapons are being used for& who there really being sold too.Instead of building an ultimate bomb for his captors he builds his first suit of armor.Though quite bulky and rough it aids  him quite well in his escape& rescue.Upon return  he annouces the new path for Stark Industries.Which as too be suspected doesn't make the board happy.For the most part he ignors whats going on around him too construct a new suit of armor-to use against the weapons he built.Meanwhile it is revealed that his kidnappers were suppose too kill him instead,and the baord is trying too buy him or atleast lock him out.too make matters worse the rebels find the remains of the first suit-and begin  too restore it.Meanwhile, someone close to Tony  is pulling everyones strings.Will Stark survive his maiden outing as IronMan?Will he beable too stop his own weapons?Will he be able too stop the new upgraded prototype and its puppetmaster?Find out go see IronMan. Notes-movie worth 2nd &3rds-Downey is perfect for the part-trial and error sequence  adds a good amount of additional comic releif.Great FX. Down side -well some parts get a little wordy but thats okay ,the climatic fight well average for this type of movie,the real let down is Starks final sentce.Kinda makes a sequal tricky.

review/text: For all my reviews visit my website  I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.  Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.  This is one of those rare ones, like The Lightning Thief, it is new Popcorn Entertainment. It ain't real entertainment, it is popcorn entertainment. For most of the movie, I enjoyed the mind-numbing action and the special effects, cheesy lines and everything else that goes good on movie snacks. Don't expect this to be the companion of The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk, this is more along the companions of Superman The Movie except modern.  One thing I found intreging is that people disrespect Robert Downey Jr., he is a great actor, I definatly like his personality. Sherlock Holmes, stuff like that. I don't think this movie DOES or DOES NOT deserve it's amount of fame, it's just fun and nothing else. It's better than what Avatar got, when it deserved nothing. Avatar was a bad movie! But, I don't wanna spend every single one of my reviews talking about how much I hate avatar.  Another thing I'm liking is the choice of AC/DC for the music score. Any movie would go great with some AC/DC my friend! (A little Metallica wouldn't hurt either.) The characters are all blockbuster hollywood of 2008, heck, that's how everything feels like, and what's to say that that's a bad thing? This ain't one of the best comic book movies ever, but it is definatly fun.  Well, that's it, don't expect the experience of your life just expect fun. There is not much more to say since the whole movie is pretty predictable in that aspect. One more thing:  I AM DA CA$HMAN, SIGNING OFF YES I AM.

review/text: A fantastic film. Possibly better than Spider-Man 3 was, but will never beat Transformers. I enjoyed the part where Stark as Iron Man blows up that tank. But I really liked it when Iron Man and the Iron Monger went to battle. I also thought that when Tony was testing the Mark II armor and crashed and was sprayed with a fire extinquisher that made me laugh. My favorite quote was "Shoot me again and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to community college". So see the movie and get the DVD.

review/text: I'm Not Much Of A Writer On Topics Like This Or Anything For That Matter.  Some People May Not Like This Movie, But If You Liked Any Other Movie Adapted From A Comic Book This One Is A Must See.  There Are Not That Many Heroes From The Comics That Do Not Have Superhuman Abilities.  Batman, Daredevil, And Iron Man Are The Three That Come To Mind And To Overcome Evil With Only Gadgets And Skill Is Impressive.  Even Though It Has Been Said That Iron Man Did Not In Many Ways Stay True To The Comics It Is Still An Entertaining "Marvel".  No Pun Intended, Being That Iron Man Was Published By Marvel Comics.  I Don't Want To Get Into Detail About What The Movie Is About, Just Keep In Mind That The First Of Every Comic Adapted Into A Movie Tells A Back Story Of How The Title Character Became Who They Were Intended To Be, Thus There Are A Few Slow Moments.  However There Are Enough Special Effects And Comic Book Action To Be Entertained.  Blu-Ray Is How Iron Man Was Intended To Be Viewed With Intense Visual Clarity And Dynamic Sound.  I Hope This Helps And Enjoy.

review/summary: Great Fe-rocious Movie
review/text: Iron Man is a must see motion picture for those who love not only comic books but also those who want to see a form of entertainment with a myriad of great action sequences and special effects. Robert Downey, Jr., I must say, is perfectly cast for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Arguably, he is a larger than life individual who is playing a character who seems to be, well, larger than life.  From a philosophical and social standpoint, one can assert that the Iron Man story portrayed on the silver screen effectively elicits the advantages and disadvantages of being charismatic and brilliant. Like Reed Richards, perhaps the greatest scientific mind in the Marvel Universe, Stark is a highly intelligent individual whose talents draw him recognition. However, unlike so many of the other big brains such as Mr. Fantastic, Stark is a socialite who both embraces and is embraced by crowds. He is a celebrity, a lady's man, and a leading industrialist who has achieved international fame. And it is because of these traits that Stark is surrounded by those who claim to be his friends or fans but who may actually be, at best, people who are trying to vicariously live off the greatness of Tony Stark or, at worst, plagiaristic, corporate sharks who want to build Stark up with hopes of eventually tearing him down.  If the focus had merely been upon the social interactions of Stark and how he could maintain his levels of success both publicly and privately, a great movie would nonetheless be developed. But lest we forget, Tony Stark is not just those roles mentioned above. Despite the many hats he has worn, there is one ultimate alloying of Stark the man and Stark the hero: TONY STARK IS IRON MAN!  And it is those scenes that define the transition and transformation from Stark the noteworthy Fortune 500 figure to The Invincible Iron Man that make the story enjoyable, even occasionally hilarious. The Tony Stark in this movie (as well as the Iron Man comic book) is not a stereotypical nerd, for unlike Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, he does not necessarily succeed with his experiments the first or second time around. In fact, he is more like Thomas Edison; he has to do it over and over......until he finally gets it right!  There are several angles and aspects by which one can ascertain this particular cinematic experience. For those who are curious about what separates Iron Man from the other excellent movies to date that are based upon the superheroes of Marvel Comics, let me say this. Tony Stark, in order to become a hero, pursued excellence with his great mind and his unique social abilities in a way that his gifts and the developments thereof would cause him to deal with those who, over time, would see themselves, by comparison, in the proverbial Sea of Mediocrity and thus become jealous not only at the interpersonal level but also at the highest ranks within government intelligence.  If you want to see one of the top five movies of the summer, if not the year, then go see Iron Man. AND DO NOT LEAVE YOUR SEAT UNTIL WELL AFTER THE END CREDITS!

review/summary: MARVELous
review/text: This is a comic book brought to life.  This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.  To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.  I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.  All I can say in the way of a hint is "what happened to the reconstructed prototype suit?"  I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them.

review/summary: Awesome inside out  **SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS**
review/text: I don't even know where to begin the describe how great the film is. Rober Downey Jr. is an excellent actor and he truely shined as Tony Spark. His character grows and develops throughout the film and the ending (sit through the credits) promises a new beginning.  The only thing that could've been better is another actress instead of Gwyneth Paltrow. Even though she previously won an Oscar, she is pretty bland and unimpressive as Tony's love interest.

review/summary: No quibbles with the movie; but the transfer team should have done better
review/text: I just want to make it clear that I love the movie.  I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}  My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team.  They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers.  They should have used DTS-HD MA.  Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally.  I found this very surprising.  Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood.  Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements.  Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?  I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp.

review/text: I liked Robert Downey, Jr. in Air America. After that, he went semi-ballistic with his substance abuse problems, and I didn't like Robert Downey, Jr. anymore. I've been an Iron Man fan, off-and-on, since Shell Head popped up in Marvel's pantheon, back in the Sixties and got a chest full of shrapnel in 'Nam. I NEVER thought Downey-the-dope-freak could be Tony Stark, the heroic heart attack in an Iron vest, fighting for the American way. All I can say is, MAN! Was I Ever WRONG?? Oh, YEAH!! Big Time WRONG. Well whaddaya know? It Works! Robert Downey, Jr. can drop the Junior part whenever he decides to, because he's playing in the Big Leagues again! This one is Out Of The Park; Downey, Bridges, Howard, Paltrow - ALL the main cast did an EXCELLENT JOB. And, just in case there's anyone still out there who HASN'T seen it but wants to, I'll shut up now. Go spend the money for the theater, then spend it again for the DVD (Get the Blu-Ray if you've got the machine for it), and ENJOY!

Christine Everhart  Jon Favreau directed this movie and plays a small role and Iron Man creator Stan Lee even has a cameo in the movie.  Personally I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role. The movie itself has a great story, great back story and outstanding ending.  The Spiderman trilogy was good, Iron Man is on a whole other level!  See this one!

review/summary: Redemption Found in An Iron Clad Heart
review/text: I saw Iron Man. I loved it.  Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., owns a weapons manufacturer. On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured. His captors are essentially killers Al-Qaeda. They want him to build this device.  In a cave, he realizes he cannot escape on his own. He'll build the bomb, and then, they'll kill him. Bad deal. He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home. Fellow captive and engineering genius Dr. Yinsen cautions him, "Don't waste your life." Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.  While in captivity, he sees that his weapons are used by the enemy. Why? How?  He had been a sleazy, rich, indulgent womanizer. Now, he sees the light. Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons. His Iron Man suit will be used for good, by him. Specifically, he will use it to take down the enemy's stock of Stark Industry weapons.  One problem. His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy. He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products. He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.  Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), previously seen as a plain assistant, starts looking good to Tony Starks. Both realize they are nowhere without the other.  What now?  Go see it. Surprise ending.  When you do, look for Stan Lee. He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.  The acting is solid, with Downey spot-on for the role. Paltrow is replaceable. Jeff Bridges, as Obadiah, is excellently cast. Shaun Toub as Dr. Yinsen carries the role impressively, though we only see him in the beginning of the movie.  Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes is the weakest link, as he comes across too feminine and insipid to be the kind of leader he should be as the liaison between Stark Industries and the military.  The movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace. The message is conflicted, however, as it is bigger guns which save the day (with some good ol' experience thrown in).  The idea of not wasting one's life -- having purpose and vision -- comes through well. This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth. Tony Stark is not perfect; some of his faults are indefensible. He is, though, a man on a mission. That's a pretty good idea for all of us.  Violent at times, horrific at others -- the terrorists here are put in their proper light, but as they murder, it is very realistic and frightening.  Sensuality -- Tony Starks is a womanizer, and we see evidence of this, especially as he seduces an equally arrogant Brown University graduate and magazine writer Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb). When Pepper Potts is escorting her out, she refers to her as trash.  Would I bring kids? Probably not. PG-13 it is rightly rated.  Look for a sequel. I fully recommend "Iron Man."

review/text: My biggest complaint about this movie is that the "big showdown battle" was between Downey and Bridges and not Downey and Say.....the kind of people who kidnapped him such as Terrorists and other scum of the Earth. I think people have never gotten a sense of "payback" after 911 and this could have been the perfect film to do just that. Instead it's wasted on two so called Business partners and of course one turns on the other. The film was fun and enjoyable for the most part, but i regret buying it for my collection.

review/summary: Suit up, Ironman, time to soar...!
review/text: Review Number 447.  What has red plates, an arc converter, firepower, the ability to fly, and Robert Downey, Jr inside? Yes, I know you know--Iron Man! What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit? A BIG HIT!  The really wild aspect of this movie is that it does not have the feel or look of a comic book. It's more akin to true sci-fi--take a man who has barbs of a modern bomb in his chest, barbs that will migrate to his heart without a battery attached to keep them stationary. Then take this same man who is a munitions genius holed up in a cave with crazed, power hungry Middle Easterners as his captors, demanding the Jericho bomb for their very own. They have many of his weapon types with the puzzling question--how did these weapons end up in their possession?  Tony Stark, son of a powerful, very wealthy weapons designer and maker, and godson of Jeff Bridges' character who assumed the mantle of the company at the founder's death, finally has an awakening to the true meaning of destruction while a captive. He must escape with the mysterious, multi-lingual man who assists him in the creation of an escape device--an iron suit, indestructible (for a short while).  I've given a background for Iron Man--how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction. Robert Downey Jr. makes this all work with his slim, but not powerful physique. He's just Joe Average physically--well, better than that because he has no fat, but he is not bulked up. It is his face, those eyes that make his every close-up so conducive to the building of the story. In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.  Other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain. My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows  he will be a villain. He looks the part! Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.  Although Gwenth Paltrow plays the handy girl assistant-- again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.  As for the S.H.E.I.L.D. agent, I expected him to say "the Other Christine" at any moment.  "Iron Man" is an exciting movie. I expect to see it again! What's the record for reviews of a movie on Amazon? I expect this one will break that record! Once a person views this film she just has to praise it--it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and....see what I mean?)

review/text: Yes I gotta agree with my Mom that Iron Man 1 was better than Iron Man 2. It is very subtle but it is there. Don Cheadle was an injustice to Terence Howard. In the pursuit of perfection as viewed in "The Making of", the personalities of the characters got nixed. If it was because of comments akin to Rick Sanchez or Mel Gibson that did Terence Howard in, then they are baseless paranoic delusions. My suspicion points to clown director/cameo Jon Navreau who maybe had a hand in this. Its too bad that the Khazarian (...) has to do these things but is it inevitable?

review/text: What I liked best about this movie was not everyone spoke English. And there were no subtitles! Here's the negative side: I could not believe a guy, who is almost dead, held prisoner in a cave, could possibly set up a foundry and a lab. He built himself a version of Robo-Cop. Meanwhile the Taliban's watching him on closed circuit TV. Needless to say, Downey escapes and gets back to the United States. But not before his robot character crashes and the Taliban pieces fragments back together again.  Downey is so smart, he can build robotry control circuits from scratch like he's making pasta. In the film he is engaged by two jet fighters, but flies faster and smarter. I did not like Jeff Bridges, as he always plays himself in these films. This was poor casting.  This plot is too much to believe. Kids will love it because kids believe anything. The movie technicians did a great job assembling parts; special effects people get an A+.  I would take my kids to see the movie. I would not take my wife, because she would rather go shopping for shoes. Oh, one last point, the role of the Air Force colonel was miscast also. If you're going to be responsible for weapons systems, you need to be sharp and proactive. This colonel should have been assigned to a freshman ROTC unit.

review/summary: Good overall, but flawed.
review/text: Overall, I enjoyed this movie alot. The special effects were good as was the action, and it had many genuinely funny moments.  The first flaw comes in the form of inappropriate content with the pole dancers in the plane and the one night stand (which could have been implied without actually having the scene in the bed - just to show Tony's self absorbed nature at the beginning of the film). These scenes added nothing to the movie and are completely inappropriate for a movie you know is targetted towards kids (why else all the Iron Man toys?).  The other flaw is a plot point. After his experience, I would think it more believable if his first reaction was to start secret investigations to find out how terrorists got his weapons, rather than deciding to stop making them altogether. (After seeing the American soldiers slautered around me, I would still be interested in making things that would give THEM the advantage in any such future engagements.)

review/summary: A Man of Iron is Sronger than a Man of Steel
review/text: While I was waiting for my ticket for Iron-Man, I got to thinking, 'Who actually has heard of Iron-Man before?'. He's not a mainstream hero like Batman or Spidy, he hasen't been to big on the comic book scene, but still, a movie was made. Whats gonna be next, a Green Lantern flick?   The plot of Iron Man is kept semi-simple, portraying Mr. Billionaire Tony Stark as a Middle Eastern hostage, forging a super-soilder suit to escape, then expanding on the idea, which turns into Iron Man. Corperate greed, double-dealing, and press coverups show a diffrent side of superheros that we've never witnessed in movies(this is before Dark Knight). Ditching the famed cookie cutter look at hero's, Iron Man dives a layer deeper into realism for a superhero.  On the down side, having the movie take more time showing the 'Fast Life' of celebraties and less of the actual Iron Man kicking booty made this feel like more a prequal, rather than the first instalment. Seeing the hero in a suit with a tie more than a metal one isen't too heroic, often he'd talk at mawk speed with press, giving sarcastic responises, which is 'chic' I guess, but not needed for a Hero movie. This was more of an orgin story on how the suit was built, and Tony's life, more than him donning his matalick tights. But when they where donned, hell hath no fury, and coolness, than Tony Stark. We need to see more of that.   Just as a side note, has anyone seen the trend right now of Superhero movies and how the baddies are dark versions of themselves? SpiderMan 3 had Venom, a dark suited villian that had exact same powers. The new Hulk featured a bigger, badder, and darker shade of green Hulk as the nemises, now Iron Man features a guy in a big grey body suit with sooped up Iron Man poweres. Is this gonna be the trend now?

review/text: Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.  Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.  There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.  The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again?  There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.  The Blu Ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of extras.

review/summary: Devil in the Details for Blu-Ray
review/text: Let me start off by saying that Iron Man is a great movie. It's easily one of the best Marvel Comics based movies I've seen, right up there with the X-Men movies and the Spiderman movies. The special effects are great and make it one of the most Blu-Ray worthy movies I've seen in a while. The action is top notch and Robert Downey Jr. nails the role of Tony Stark dead on.  Unfortunately, I have to knock down the rating for one simple reason. The blue ring of death that occurs because of the player trying to download the BDLive content is inexcusable. Basically, you absolutely cannot play the movie because your Blu-Ray player is trying to access web-based special content. I'm sure this will be cleared up once traffic to the server is cleared up. Until then, there's a problem.  Yes there it is a simple matter to go into your settings and turn off the internet connection or disable BDLive. But there is no mention on the package that this blue ring of death could happen nor any mention of how to clear it up. I had no way of knowing that this is what the problem was. I came pretty close to taking my copy back to the store I got it from and exchanging it for another disk that would have the same problem. It's only because I happened to see G.Chance's review that I saved myself the trouble. Thanks G.Chance. That's well worth a helpful vote.  I paid Blu-Ray prices for a Hi-Def movie, not for a puzzle with no clue as how to solve it. Quality Control really dropped the ball on this one.  However, like I said, this is a great movie. I'm sure once the server traffic lightens up, things will work fine. Until then, there are going to be a lot of people wondering what's wrong with their disks. Not a good way to start a release, Paramount.

review/text: I may not be "the guy" to review this flick because frankly, I'm not a Marvel comic junky. When I reach into my holster for comic-to-cinema, I only come up with Spidey Part Deaux and Batman Begins...so there you have it.  Do I love RDJ? Yesssssssss! Jeff Bridges, too for that matter. Still, I didn't get the smarmy fun out of this movie I was hoping for based on the pre-release hype. Certainly watchable even for the non-die-hards, I just can't find myself gushing over it as I hoped I would.

review/summary: Marvelous Script?
review/text: Hype can work against anything that is mediocre. If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation. When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter. This movie didn't live up to hype or the methods they could have used to tell this story.  As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK. Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got. However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me. It didn't. I think they took pains to make Tony Stark and the birth of this franchise believable and that made the first 25 minutes slow.  There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here. Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman. I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s), The Punisher and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends. These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we got a movie that spent too much time laying the ground work to become the Ironman franchise.  In my opinion Jon Favreau did a great job, Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job, and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well. They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with. I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.  Edited on October 11, 08:  At first I was very disappointed with the movie, even regretted purchasing it.  Now I have watched it 2 more times and I have actually enjoyed it more each time.  The Blue Ray 2nd disc is really interesting with an entire breakdown of the process from set location to casting, all the way to title graphics and sound editing.  If you like to see how movies are made this is one of the better bonus discs I have seen.  For the action, thriller, buff it is actually more like a 3 star to 4 star movie.

review/summary: This was it? Really?
review/text: I never jumped on the Ironman bandwagon because I wasn't blown away by the trailers and I'm skeptical of superhero movies. But over time after reviews by critics and moviegoers I actually watched this movie last night.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The opening scene where Tony Stark riding in a hummer with GI's through Afghanistan was laughable in my eyes. First off it opens up with some guitar music...and I immediately thought "oh great... ok it's that kind of movie!" but i stuck with it. People say RDJ character is witty? Seriously? I thought his wittiness was amateur, expected, uncreative and cliche from a half ass writer and a director who should go back to doing cameos in Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Piven movies.  Then there's the scene where a hot journalist interviews Tony Stark before jumping into a limo. He gives some arrogant cliche line about maybe stop making weapons and making baby cribs and bottles. then all of the sudden they're naked rolling around in bed. Seriously, wtf? His helper (don't recall catching his name) in the cave in Afghanistan was also laughable. His presence only provided the watcher a gimmick into the idea that Tony Stark is softer then he appears without actually developing Tony Stark character. I laughed out loud when his helper was found dying at the opening of the cave. He whispers and mumbles things in his dying breath to Stark that Stark will take with him forever...but the watcher will never remember that guy who made Stark change because as i said...it's just a gimmick to cover up for bad character creation and writing.  The relationship between Stark and Pepper Potts was predictable before they even spoke, and seemed to use every cliche in the book.  Ironicly the best acting in my opinion in this overrated Fantastic Four in a Ironman suite of a movie was Jeff Bridges. I honestly thought the best part of the movie was when RDJ and Bridges spoke in front of the giant ARC reactor discussing Stark's decision to go away from making weapons. Bridges in that moment seemed like he could be inserted into any scene in Mad Men.  One of the best tips I've read from writers like Harlan Ellison is that you have to leave cliffhangers, keep the audience or reader guessing to which direction a story will go. That leaves them immersed and feeling like they are apart of it. At no point in this movie did I ever think to myself "damn, i wonder what that's about", ever feeling I was unsure on what side of the fence a character stood, or feeling slightly sympathetic to a villain like I did with the Joker in The Dark Knight. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the entire movie.

review/summary: DON'T BUY IT, RENT IT!
review/text: This IRON TURKEY isn't a flick you're likely to want to view twice.  Oh, it may well be a reasoable or even a competent recreation of a Marvel Comic strip Superhero, I don't know because prior to the film's publicity I was unfamiliar with the Superhero.  But, the publicity campaign was effective and the effort was touted as having been produced with a high level of artistic skill and vision.  Nevertheless, five or ten minutes of viewing time, showed the effort to be considerably below the level of other recent films in the Cape/Action/Superhero genre.  It was patently inferior to HELLBOY, for example, on every level.  Or the latest BATMAN.  What's it about?  Not much.  The first fifteen minutes of the film is so dark and the sound is so confused and muddy, one sits stymied, wondering what comes next.  All this takes place somwhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area.  An American arms manufacturer is captured by terrorists of some sort, who live in caves.  (All very well played and costumed, by the way; most effective.)  They want this man, Tony Stark of Stark Munitions, to make a "guided" missle for them.  Tony has been seriously wounded and now wears a sort of big flashlight diode aray where his sternum ought to be.  (Idiotic justification.)  Aided by a doomed multi-lingual individual of uncertain origin -- who is somewhat interesting in spite of the far-fetched and murky dialogue -- Stark builds a self-powered, napalm-spurting flying suit of armor, and escapes the cave.  He crashes in the desert and is promptly picke up by American copters.  Next, he has a one-line epiphany on his way home, which he announces at an impromptu news conference.  He intends to lead Stark Enterprises "out of the munitions business."  Into what, everyone wants to know?  "I don't know yet," he replies.  Now here we have to pay close attention to Jeff Bridges as he proceeds to fold the movie up, stick it in his breast pocket and walk away with it.  He's absolutely terrific; the best thing in the movie, by far, playing the role Kris Kristoffersen aced often, and last for Wesley Snipes; that of the substitute father-figure.  Here he's Big Daddy Warbucks with a shaved head and white beard, sporting good suits and an enormous cigar.  A baddie too, for all the difference it makes.  But so good and so likeable you yearn to see him from scene to scene until, at the very end, he re-appears driving and 'wearing' a super-flying enhanced armored suit to battle the smaller Tony character in his smaller suit: its like the mano-a-mano last scene in ROBOCOP as the good Humanist Robo battles the bad Corporate Robo.  Not better, just similar.  Second best?  Gwenneth Paltrow with a discreetly padded chest, sporting an orange wig and the highest possible stilettoes.  She has nothing to work with, character-wise or script-wise, but manages to create the impression that she endures labial seizures every time her co-star comes near to her.  Its a feat of acting ability and almost comic, because Downey never does anything that even remotely suggests any degree of physical intimacy.  Endlessly condescending, he ignores her and talks over her constantly.  Cold and narcissistic, he touches her once when they briefly dance together for a few seconds.  Prior to this, she does what Lois Stewart did as Miss Moneypenny in the JAMES BOND Series, rolling her eyes and appearing to ooze as Bond passes by.  BACK TO THE PLOT.  What's Tony up to?  After his vapid revelation?  He's at work in the billionairei's workshop - garage under his huge  billionaire's hilltop Malibu cottage, re-fashioning a better version of the iron suit he made whilst among the brigands.  Very flashy toys on display.  Virtual this and that.  Flashy cars.  Flashy welding and tooling equipment.  Super electronics to handle his secret Power "Source."  Tedium.  Meanwhile, Daddy Warbucks reveals himself as working to take over STARK ENTERPRISES for himself.  Purpose?  To sell the newest munitions to the insurgents in the hills.  Tony  finds out and flies -- that's right, flies to Afghanistan -- and Flying ROBOCOP blasts the baddies himself by means of the diodes in his palms and on the soles of his feet.  He is attacked by jet planes, but escapes.  And then, finally, he meets his nemesis at Stark Labs Headquarters and they fight it out.  Well, if you enjoy this genre of action movies -- capes and gadgets and super-powers -- you accept the improbabilites that go along with the fantasies.  And,  you have your roster of favorite stars, and you might have wondered  how it came about that Robert downey Jr got cast in the role?  Especially when there's Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Vin Diesel or Wesley Snipes.  And that's just the Americans.  Unless you figure they'd be an ethnic stretch for the story.  But then there's Christian Bale, Patrick Swayze, Orlando Bloom or even Mat Damon and Ben Afflek.  And from the set-up, one wonders if IRON MAN might not have been intended for Afflek or Damon?  La Paltrow is a personal friend of both men and has appeared with them both in various films.  Afflek did well in DAREDEVIL, which did well at the Box Office.  Did he tire of the tights and pulleys and wires?  Or did Damon commit, and then refuse at the last minute, or after reading the script?  Leaving...  Gweneth, and crew.  Money talks, or in this case, it keeps mum.  The project is odd, yet conventional, without being entertaining in an unconventional way.  It gave off the feeling of having been stitched together out of whole pieces of comic book and monster movie cliches.  Downey doing his red carpet celebrity walk through the crowds while not speaking to anybody directly -- which he did so perfectly in SOAP DISH, one of the best Show-Biz comedies of the 80s -- in imitation of Bruce Wayne' many entries and exits in all of the latest BATMAN flicks.  But why Downey, particularly?  And what about DOWNEY anyway?  Well, since his publicized recouperation, it is obvious that the course of treatment involved an intense regimen of body-building, for the actor has managed to become an obvious Gym-Rat, and Gym-Rats have something in common with Downs syndrome people.  As Downs sufferers share a round-faced, slant-eyed asian appearance, so Gym-Rats share a gaunt, sunken-cheeked volpine resemblence that makes them look like brothers.  Astonishingly, Downey with his pitch black hair, thick browns and inky moustache and goatee, has become the identical twin of venerable Gay porn performer and total Gym Rat, Jason Probe aka Joshua Perez.  Well, let me put it to you this way:  Downey is rather a small, compact man.  Everybody in the entire movie is bigger than he is, and some tower over him.  This is a very odd handicap for a Superhero.  Which makes me wonder why anybody would cast this movie in that way?  What is the point?  The Mighty Mouse effect.  It trivializes everything the hero does.  And if Mr. Downey's height wasn't a consideration in the casting of this movie, why would any producer hire the same casting people to do another job?  This is a re-hash of the old BULLETMAN strip.  But, as I say.  Look at it once and return it the next day.  It's good for a bag of popcorn.

review/summary: RoboCop 2 Rip-Off
review/text: I've heard how great this movie is for months.  So I finally get to see it...and it seemed like 2 hours before he finally got the damn suit on.  Pretty slow build-up there.  Also the "villain" was...nobody.  Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the "change of heart" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.  But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.  Sound familiar?  Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?  So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).  That one's not afraid to splatter blood all over too, instead of G-rating the action for the kiddies.

review/text: "Iron Man" is a great movie.  It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie.  I cannot claim to be a Hollywood movie critic.  I am not going to dissect the acting skills of every actor or the quality of the scenes.  All I can say is this - when a movie is over, if I feel moved because of the message it delivers or, in the case of Iron Man, I am excited about the action, etc., and can't wait to watch it again, then I consider it a great movie!  Iron Man is a great action movie, pure & simple.  If you like things that fly, explosions, etc., all delivered with a Sci-Fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.  The Blu-Ray version is superb....explosions, fighting, etc., all provide excellent audio quality.  The video is very good.  In summary, I think it's classic movie fun....sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a fun ride!

review/text: I had wanted to get this on Blu-Ray for a long time now, but only recently pulled the trigger on it.  I have to say that it lived up to all of the hype. It is a great picture quality and a great audio track.  For fans of the movie, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version.

review/summary: Flashy and self-indulgent, but relentlessly entertaining as well
review/text: I'll be the first to admit here that I'm really not a comics buff.  I buy comics occasionally and sometimes, I like them. But the comics I buy are far more likely to be, say, the newest trade paperback of Knights of the Old Republic than a Spider-Man comic. In fact, I've never bought a typical superhero comic book, though I've read a few. In part that's because I'm obsessive over continuity and I couldn't force myself to read every Spider-Man, X-Men, or Batman comic in existence. So when I read superhero comics I tend to lean towards new continuities, such as Ultimate Marvel.  So I like superhero movies. When they're good. I thought the first Hulk film was embarassingly awful, in spite of having an excellent director and cast. I was passionately disappointed with both the third Spider-Man and X-Men films and I, to this day, still don't understand what's so good about the new Superman movie (but then again I always thought that character was silly). So given all the disappointments I wasn't sure what to expect of the new Iron Man film. On the one hand, the previews looked good, the ratings from critics were astounding (the best rated film this year!), and people had told me it was good. So I had high expectations. But a tiny, little voice inside of me kept telling me that I was setting up for a disappointment, to remember last few year's superhero movies, and that the hype never is lived up to.  Fortunately, that little voice was wrong - this time.  Surprisingly, given the fact that the script wasn't finished at the time of filming, the story is one of Iron Man's strongest points.  The story of Tony Stark's transformation from billionaire to superhero is handled alot better than many origin stories, which often come off as what they are - preludes, prologues, promises for a bigger story. It was the problem with the first Spider-Man film and it was even worse for the first X-Men. But Iron Man, like Batman Begins delivers a story that both promises more (particularly in the last scenes of both) but at the same time delivers a fun and complete story in of itself. Maybe it has something to do with superheroes that don't have superpowers. Or maybe it's because the folks at both Marvel and DC are beginning to realize they need to reinvent the superhero movie into something more in order to retain audience interest after so many.  And like the best of the Marvel films it doesn't rely on knowledge of the old superhero comics on which it is based, drawing from both the old continuity and the new Ultimate Marvel stuff. Which is probably the best way to go through with it, since a lot of fans have nostalgia for the old comics but whereas Ultimate Marvel is more befitting for our current time.  Tony Stark, of course, steals the show and not least because of the acting behind him. But he also stands on his own as a wry, egotistical, and intelligent superhero who stands out from just about every other superhero. There's not really, as far as I can tell, another guy like him in either the Marvel or DC universes. There's of course the paladin-esque superheroes like Spider-Man or Superman and there's the anti-heroes like Wolverine or Batman (at his best, so long as he doesn't delve into Miller-machismo). But there's not really another superhero who both plays the Lawful Good card and can act like a scoundrel at the same time. It's a nice juggling act and done well here.  The transformation of Stark into... a weapons-hater is a little less convincing. This is derived, from what I understand, was a major shift in Marvel's approach to the Vietnam War back in the 1970s, when their readers made it clear they opposed the war (which Iron Man had previously been supporting). So they made Stark into a pseudo-pacifist, which really doesn't work. Thankfully they figure that out and moved on, turning him once again into a super-soldier, though one with a strong set of moral boundaries. I have a feeling, given how Iron Man acts in the film, that this is sort of where Stark is going in the films as well. A good thing too as the whole concept of a superhero walking around in a combat exoskeleton who believes weapons are by default evil and should be destroyed is hardly believable.  That said, he doesn't lose his touch once he makes the transformation.  As for the supporting characters one of the more interesting is Obadiah Stane, who I'd thought was an original character but who I later learned is from the comics. Although near the end of the film his character declines into cliches throughout about 80% of the film he's as engaging as Stark himself. He fills that borderline between comfort and discomfort, of a character you can't quite really decide on who he is or what he stands for. He's elusive. And that's how it's meant to be and that's how it should be. On the other hand, James Rhodes is less interesting as a character though he still manages to make himself endearing. More or less he's the military man stuck with a guy (Stark, of course) who he likes but can't help but realize is a total pain in the ass. Similarly, Stark's Girl Friday "Pepper Potts" (how I wish I was making that name up) is thoroughly and irredeemably boring. Why is it that superhero girlfriends have always got to be absolutely unmissable?  The special effects in Iron Man are pretty good - though they're not the best I've seen, either in film *or* in television (they're roughly Battlestar-like in quality). As good as the effects are though, they're not the star of the film's production values. That's the cast. Indeed, there are a large number of big-name actors in this film - the biggest name being the aforementioned Gwyneth Paltrow though oddly she's the least interesting of the cast. But, Robert Downey Jr. (as the titular Iron Man / Tony Stark) and Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane) are the true stars of this film and fill out their roles wonderfully, bringing wit and life to the characters they play.  Downey is likely the best casting choice for a superhero lead since Christian Bale and, as OSC put it, "we never get a sense that the actor is playing his part with tongue in cheek; instead, Downey is playing a character who lives his life with tongue in cheek." And Downey does this wonderfully. Likewise, Bridges is excellent.  Overall, Iron Man is a brilliant superhero film that, alongside The Dark Knight, has helped to reinvigorate the genre.

review/summary: Love Iron Man? You'll Love This Movie. Never Heard of Iron Man? You'll Love This Movie.
review/text: I really liked this film. It's the best Marvel Comics movie yet. As a long time comic book fan, I find this movie fascinating for how it combines elements of the original comics with new takes on the character, all to perfectly capture his essence.  Iron Man first appeared in 1963. Stan Lee who created the character and wrote his early adventures makes no secret of the fact that Tony Stark was originally based on Howard Hughes. I'm not talking the later, paranoid, mentally unhinged, obsessively germophobic, hasn't-trimmed-his-fingernails-or-taken-bath-in-five years Howard Hughes, I'm talking the young, amazingly good looking, high-level genius, kinda-looks-ike-Errol-Flynn-and-bonks-any-gorgeous-Hollywood-starlet-he-wants-to Howard Hughes.  The early parts of the movie pretty much follow the 1963 origin. While in a foreign country supporting the American war effort (in 1963 it was Vietnam and doing a field review of Stark-designed weapons' performance, in 2008 it's updated to the War on Terror and hawking the Jericho missile system), Tony Stark is severely wounded in an explosion, a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart that will in weeks work itself inward and kill him. Imprisoned with Professor Yinsen (originally Vietnamese, natch, in the movie not) they work together to free themselves from the evil warlord who has imprisoned them both. Tony builds an armored chest plate that will keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart, and around that he and Yinsen design and build a crude suit of armor, somewhat paradoxically inset with all the cutting edge technological weaponry that a high-level genius intellect, feverishly battling for freedom and against death, can invent when pushed to the edge under incredible time pressure. Tony uses the first, bulky, prototype Iron Man armor to escape but Yinsen dies in the attempt.  Stan Lee always felt that every good hero, no matter how powerful, should have a counterbalancing weakness. In Tony's case it's the damage to his heart, and the irony (pun intended) that the Iron Man armor (or at least the chest plate of same) is not just there to be his superheroic identity, it's a necessity to keep him alive. Tony can never take off the chest plate, he has to wear it constantly, hidden under his clothes when not Iron Man, openly when he is. Eventually this goes away when Tony's damaged heart is removed and replaced with a cybernetic heart of his own design. Overtones of the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man without a heart do occur to me.  But...I get ahead of myself. Back to the early comic books, and the movie's storyline.  When Tony returns to the world, in short order, having seen and felt the ravages of war up-close and personal, he terminates Stark Industries' production of war materiel. Up til this point, the movie is pretty much a well-produced updating of the original story.  The rest of the movie skips ahead and pillages ideas from Iron Man stories of decades later, specifically Iron Man's conflict with Obadiah Stane who starts out as Stark's business rival and eventually dons a set of armor called Iron Monger to become Tony's armored antagonist. (Iron Man is always at his best when he's battling high-tech armored villains with suits to pit against his own.) In the movie Stane is recast as Tony's business partner and paternal figure after his own father's death.  We do skip in the movie the iterations of Iron Man armor between the first gray suit and the most current versions which are visually based on Japanese samurai armor, very techno-geek manga-esque. In particular we skip the sleek design that Stark wore longer than any other suit, and for me has always been THE classic Iron Man.  Pepper Potts was an early cast member who then disappeared for decades before eventually being reintegrated into the Iron Man mythos. James Rhodes (Rhodey), though retconned as one of Stark's oldest friends, was actually a much later addition to the series, not first appearing until the late 1970s. They both work well as supporting characters in the movie. The robot Jarvis, for those who aren't comic book fans and thus don't get the little in-joke, is a play on the long running character of the Avengers' butler, Englishman Edwin Jarvis.  The linchpin of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark. When I first heard of his casting, it was from a guy bitching about what a BAD idea he thought it was. "Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, that's just ridiculous." I said slowly as I thought about it, "Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark....that's just F--KING BRILLIANT. Perfect casting." And it was. Downey Jr. can play an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict (I've heard it said we'll get into Tony's alcoholism in the second film) because he is in fact an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict. It's tempting to say that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role.

review/summary: Birth of new film franchise never misses a step - fantastic adaptation
review/text: Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book "Ironman" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.  So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from "Swingers" and "Elf") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.  Start with a clever and detailed "birth of Ironman" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, "Ironman" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.  Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.  I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into "Phantom Menace" cartoonishness.  An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut ("Ironman 2" and "Ironman 3" are already in pre-production), "Ironman" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt.

This is still available at my Target but you have to go to the back section of DVD's under "Best Sellers". I found it between the 2 disc special edition of Iron Man and Jeff Dunham Spark of Insanity. I suggest throwing away the plastic case that the mask comes in cause you're really not gonna need it. So it is the same as the 2 disc edition. I would use the Hall of Armor feature most. This is also like The Dark Knight Batman Head Case. I recomend buying it.

review/summary: Iron Man Has Soul
review/text: Iron Man and Ray Stark are new to me. I am not a comic book or fantasy fan. However, I enjoyed this film tremendously. The plot though thin, rang true and the superhero is expected to do some real acting. Though his feats are amazing, it is the scenery, his soul and the people supporting him that make this film so good.   Robert Downey, Jr plays Ray Stark, he owns a company that makes and sells high tech weaponry. At the moment he is in Afghanistan showing off his weaponry, when his group is attacked. He spends the next three months  building a suit to protect his new heart and himself. In the process he escapes and comes back to to life in California. Iron Man has a great cast of characters- Terrence Howard, as the military man, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girl Friday and Jeff Bridges as his accomplice in the company- Bridges really wears black. Needless  to say the plot thickens and Iron Man goes on to build a new suit to defend his newly found ethical behavior and save the day.  Save the day, he does- Robert Downy Jr is a first rate actor with emotional liability and he is the Iron Man. The other actors are also first rate and this is the film of the past year, IMO.  There is a shocking revelation and the hardware is impressive. This is a fun film for all.  The computer aided visuals are impressive and Iron Man, well he has Soul!  Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-02-09  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DE29SS">Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)</a>

review/summary: SOMETHING VERY GAY ABOUT THIS FLICK!!
review/text: Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character was not hard enough for me and when you are a Superhero, you have to be extra hard in and out of costume!! I didn't like how every opportunity he got to turn down a kiss and sex he did so like he was fully aware of his homosexual following was watching and chose not to disappoint them. The scene where he is with his contraption looked just like he was caught "gettin off". As for the movie itself it was just ok and not spectacular like it should have been(like 300!). He had no true evil adversary to boost his skill level alot more so all we are left with is admiring his suit which was very cool. Marvel is so trippin' not basing alot of their stories straight out of their comic book pages and it is hurting their attempts to showcase these easy ones and they are not hitting the mark. Big budget advertising and the good box office receipts still don't impress me as I am very well versed on all these characters and see the holes very well. I would for one like it if they start making them R-rated instead of the safe PG(There are enuff kids movies already!!) which forces them to take more chances and be more creative in the action and plots. I saw more drama in Todd Mcfarlanes animated Spawn series on HBO than these movies Marvel has been producing! While it is good that they are coming out more frequently than before, they need to focus more on making these huge budget hero movies for adults where the kids can come with the parents and be braced for a cool and wild ride again like the blockbuster "300". The audience for it is definitely there and so is the big box office they want as long as the story , action and plot stays in tact. And finally, let the fellas "get some" please?!!  Better than the new Hulk but not that much. I rate it a C.  Thanks Again Ya'll!!

review/summary: Marvelous? Weak Script
review/text: Hype can work against anything that is mediocre.  If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation.  When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter.  This movie didn't live up to that scrutiny.  As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK.  Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got.  However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me.  It didn't.  There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here.  Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman.  I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s) and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends.  These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we just got a movie.  In my opinion Jon Favreau did a good job, Robert Downey did an excellent job and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well.  They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with.  I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.  Personally, I wish I would have rented this one rather than buying it.

review/text: Okay, the movie's fine, but if they're going to give you two disks, why can't they include the freaking full-frame version for those of us who hate trying to see what's between the two black panels?  The script is well written and the movie's well cast; still, the effects are no better than one sees in some U-Tube productions. If you're going to put someone in a metal suit and send them zipping through the sky, you can do much more than was done in this film. It screamed "computer generated," which was a shame. I could have done much better with an empty Iron Man suit, a helicopter, some cables and some clouds. When is Hollywood going to realize we don't need to see protracted shots of Iron Man flying? Put a camera in an airplane or helicopter, shoot at a high framerame and get as close to the ocean or land as you can get and go.  I never thought, with technology being as good as it is today, that I'd be sitting back in a theater seat and thinking, "Fake! Fake!" If my standards were that bad, I'd still be watching LOIS AND CLARK reruns and save money in watching this stuff!  Still, the movie makes it solely on the script, though stylistically I thik it could have been better. The actors and writers can't be faulted.

review/summary: Robocop flies to Afghanistan!
review/text: This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intruiging: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.  There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).  When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).  Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.  In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.

review/summary: Ironman Flops
review/text: This movie spends 7/8 of it building the plot. There are 2 action scenes,  only one of which has any substance and duration.  This movie cannot compare to any of the other comic book movies on any level. If there is a sequel it stands a slim chance of being good but it cannot be any worse. Ironman for a superhero is as weak a character as Magneto, or Aquaman, or Greenlantern. It cannot touch Superman, Batman or Spiderman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.This cannot be classified as an action movie, it is a total sleeper.

review/summary: dark, cynical, not for kids
review/text: The worst film I've seen in a long time.  Senseless violence, one-dimensional characters and outright racist portrayals of arabs.  Robert Downey Jr. shows the emotional range of an earthworm.  He wisecracks stone-faced throughout, although doesn't seem to care one way or the other what happens to him or anyone around him.  The one opportunity for redemption falls flat, as there's no real change after the press conference.  The romantic interest is forced and uncomfortable.  You have to sit through two hours of tepid "build-up" before Iron Man actually battles a bad guy.  Let's hope this is the last we see from this group.

review/summary: Iron Man + Blu Ray = EPIC FAIL
review/text: Its 9-30 and Iron Man is OUT on Blu-Ray! What could go wrong?  Oh... DISK 1 FAILS TO LOAD?!?!?! - This is a KNOWN ISSUE...????  [...]  Here is what was said:  " by Wayde Robson -- last modified September 25, 2008 18:28 Iron Man on Blu-ray - May Have Dodged a Missile  In true super-hero style - Iron Man might have narrowly avoided a near disaster. No, it wasn't an explosive missile from his arch-nemesis in the film, Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges. Instead it was something that could have been devastating for the film's Blu-ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu-ray format overall.  It seems retailers carrying Iron Man on Blu-ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount. Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu-ray's high definition picture quality and Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio. It could have been a real set-back for the format itself at this critical juncture as Iron Man could be one of Blu-ray's break-out titles.  Due to an apparent authoring problem with the disc Paramount has recalled the Blu-ray version of Iron Man from retailers. Rumor has it the problem was with disc 1 playing back in certain Sony Blu-ray players.  The studio received reports of compatibility issues with review copies that had been sent out weeks ago. Distributors have only recently been told to send back all copies of the disc. As a result Paramount has stated that it may have to delay the title's release date to October 7.  While a one week delay for the Blu-ray release date may not seem like much, especially after the Godfather Trilogy's release this week - which should keep many BD fans busy, if Paramount decides to go ahead with the DVD release on schedule it will almost certainly hurt Blu-ray sales.  But according to some sources, the word from Paramount is that the studio is working around the clock and determined to meet the official release date of Sept. 30. Some have even reported that they've already received a fixed copy of the Iron Man Blu-ray disc so it looks like old ShellHead might have dodged a damaging projectile that wasn't in the script."  Amazon did an Excellent job in sending out a replacement disk - BUT - I now fear that any replacement will also have this Issue... (5 Star Support - Thanks Amazon)  USE CAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY!  FYI: I am using a PS3 80GB as my player and online update confirms I have the latest firmware!  Buyer-Be-Ware.

review/summary: Am I the ONLY one who wasn't impressed???
review/text: I vowed some time ago to, once and for all, stopping handing over my time, money and brain cells to sequels, threequels, remakes and franchise.  So since this was the first time IRON MAN was being brought to the big screen, I figured I was safe and would be treated to a good, original superhero movie to follow in the steps of the original Superman, Batman, X-Men and Spiderman.  In my (surprised) opinion, no so.  While Robert Downy Jr's acting and spontaneous ability for dialogue and wit never fail to please, the story, for me, fell very short.  If this film is, indeed, based on the original comic book story of Iron Man, then the story failed to impress me.  In this film, it seems you spend more time watching the endless, ongoing process of how his superhero suit is created step-by-step rather than the action and the danger that you crave.  To make matters worse, I felt there were way too many stupid jokes and sight gags inserted into a film that I thought would be much darker, judging by the trailer I'd seen.  I'm afraid that IRON MAN gets thrown on the scrap heaps of bad superhero movies like FANTASTIC FOUR.  And Hollywood can rest assured that I will be going nowhere near IRON MAN II, III, IV, etc.

review/summary: Iron-head tells kids to have sex with strangers.
review/text: "Iron-Head" only has great special-effects. The film has a weak script; for example; Robert Downey Jr. leaves secret robot plans and later, parts out in the open for the pursuing enemy to find. His assistant Gwyneth Paltrow threatens to quit when he readies violence to stop the bad guys who are killing innocent people.  I would still have given 3-stars for the great special-effects, except the film tells teenagers and children, who we know are watching, to have sex with strangers. Robert Downey Jr. has sex with a woman he has just met that afternoon, whom he does not know; on top of one another, in bed, in the middle of the night; with Robert Downey Jr. in the process of undressing. This film was accompanied by children's comic-books, little-kid-size Halloween-costumes, and Iron-Head action-figures; showing younger children are targeted. What boy would not be thrilled to see a flying robot-suit. I am sure we will see Robert Downey Jr. promoting sexual-immorality in Iron-Head-2. Nowhere do we see Robert Downey Jr. show a change of heart. He fights the bad guys only because they attack him first. Real heroes do not make comic-book-hero films for kids that glorify having sex outside of marriage and with people you do not know.

review/text: A big fan of comics, I really, really wanted to like Iron Man, but it left me cold. Wasted talent (Ms. Paltrow (wasted!) & Mr. Bridges, in particular), plot holes, a completely schizophrenic conversion by Tony Stark ("I realize that my family's business is war, so I'll rectify that by building a legendary suit of armor, flying around the world and killing people!"), and racist portrayals of terrorists, the villian du jour.  I started getting bored about 1/2 hour into the movie, and it went downhill from there ...  Seriously. Hollywood spends a kabillion dollars on this movie, and this is the best script they can come up with? The script felt completely formulaic, paint-by-numbers, and predictable.  Finally ... I seem to be in the minority here, but when I watch Robert Downey Jr. acting, all I see is a man playing Robert Downey Jr. ... in every movie.

review/summary: First 1/3 pretty good, then, quite shallow
review/text: This review is for theatrical release as the DVDs aren't out yet. Besically this is your regular summer entertainment almost all the way. A superhero action movie done by-the-book. Main character (a weapons merchant/manufacturer) is caught and held hostage by generic bad guys, terrorists or just warmongers, it's not explained. What the viewer has to know is that they are bad to the bone. Their leader has plans for world domination. The hero secretly builds a powered suit of steel armor and escapes. In captivity he undergoes some sort of change of mind and doesn't want to make weapons anymore.  The conflicts in this movie are very simple and show opposing sides playing the game of escalation in which the former weapon merchant and genius inventor clearly wins.  Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) is expectedly very good, although I have a feeling he didn't have to strain himself very much playing the cartoonish Tony Stark/Ironman. He definitely makes the best from what he gets. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) is WASTED in a subplot which leads nowhere. At least her character (excuse my forgetting her name) gets lots of money from the Stark's company. Jeff Bridges (Big Lebowski) (another actor wasted) plays the company co-owner and, by the end of the movie, a giant evil robot, a villain whose motivation is money. There is also the general (another wasted actor, sorry for not remembering the name) who is only there to show that Stark has a friend and to prevent IM being shot down by american forces.  There was not a shred of good dialogue in the movie, except for several Stark one-liners included for laughs (some of them actually funny `tho). Special effects are cool and are the best part of the movie and prevent it from being a complete disaster. Ending is incredibly weak. The first 1/3 (or so) lets you expect something that doesn't come later. Stark escapes and from there the intelligence of the movie goes downhill. All in all this is a good summer entertainment but nothing to ponder about after watching.

Sure it had it's funny moments as Stark builds his second Iron Man suit as well as one good action sequence once the suit was completed.  Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow were completely wasted.  Terrence Howard's character could have been written out of the script without affecting what little story this movie had.  The Jeff Bridges character is what Mike Myers mocked as Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies, all that was missing was a cat to rub.

review/text: This is targeted for young people as well as adults, but it has scenes that are completely innapropriate for young teenagers.  I was hoping for an enjoyable hero movie, like Batman Begins, but instead it started with a bedroom sex scene only masked by a sheet.  This is wrong-headed for a teen movie.  Then they made repeated references to him having sex with journalists, again inappropriate for a movie targeted at teens.  Then, Downey's acting was lame. "OK, I'm the Iron Man."  What a dumb ending. Nothing like Batman Begins which drew me into the character, or the more plausible technologies used.  Some of the special effects were fine, but it had far too much stupid stuff like:  He crash landed in the dessert from like 3,000 feet and didn't get hurt or  he had icing problems at 80,000 feet where icing does not occur...it occurs where there's moisture, in clouds, or  Downey builds this hi-tech robot suit in a cave without his captors figuring out what he's doing...uh, that was really stupid.

review/summary: One of the most racist movies I've ever seen.
review/text: The special effects were excellent.  There were moments of comedy, and the plot was decent.  I particularly appreciated the attempt to support nonviolent action.  The acting by Jeff Bridges, Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow was amazing- though some credit needs to go to the make-up job as well.  I was racking my brain, for I knew I'd seen these actors before, but they did such a good job of embracing new characters, of becoming characters, that I lost sight of the actors themselves.  This had the makings of a great movie, for its genre.  There are some glitches, however.  Repeatedly people go into Stark's chest cavity without a sterile environment- when everyone knows this is just a recipe for infection and disease.  There are difficulties with how fast the villain learns how to use the weapons.  But of greatest difficulty is the dating of the material.  Honestly.  We are in the 21st century.  Do we still need caricatures of people groups appearing as incompetent buffoons and inherently evil?  This film reads as if the director took his cues from Shaheen's Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People</a>.  Nearly every classic point of Arab stereotyping in Hollywood is followed by this movie.  A full third of the runtime is spent with the evil Muslims and Arabs, yelling in Arabic and killing people and thirsting for more weapons.  All of this takes place in Afghanistan, but there seem to be few Afghanis around.  It's a multinational terrorist force, run mostly by Arabs, and in Arabic.  Sure, it's only a comic book movie. I'm not expecting the in-depth real-life drama of the Afghani The Kite Runner</a>.  But comics and the movies- indeed all of popular culture- have the ability to greatly influence us.  This after all is the goal of anyone who creates a quality movie.  Indeed, this has often been the maxim of The Great One - Stan Lee (who incidentally has his best cameo ever in this film).  Stan Lee often speaks of how much comics can influence culture, that they should not be viewed merely as comics.  He often very purposely puts his crusade for justice into the midst of his characters and stories. Sadly, some don't take the words of the author seriously- that his stories matter, that justice matters.  There is of course the courtesy good Arab guy who initially helps Stark out, but we barely know he's Arabic.  He looks less swarthy, he's a polyglot, and rarely speaks Arabic.  In mannerisms and culture he acts like a typical American- letting us know that Arabs are alright as long as they are so much like us that we don't have to realize that they are Arabic.  As my stomach turned, I kept hoping that the movie would somehow redeem its initial treatment of Arabs, perhaps showing us in some way how the Arabs in the movie came to desire weapons, because their homes were trashed by the Americans and Stark was selling weapons everywhere.  Evidently no redemption was possible.  With one exception, the only people Iron Man kills are Arabs, but there are thrilling moments of him going out of his way to rescue Americans who were attacking him.  (By this point we've obviously lost the hope for the non-violent focus that was initially so promising.)  The coup de grace is the line from the ultimate villain to the head Arab villain, that "their part of the world" has never been able to keep up technologically.  It's not just that the Arabs are villains.  They are bad villains.  They can't even do that right.  The issue of course is not one movie.  It is rather that, in the thousands of movies that Arabs and Muslims have been shown in in Hollywood history, nearly all of them have been stereotypical or negative portrayals.  (About fifty have been positive.)  And Iron Man has suddenly risen to the top of this infamous list.  There was no need to use Arabs and Muslims in this modern portrayal of the Iron Man myth, for there are plenty of other villains around.  If Arabs were to be the villains, there was no need to show them as stereotypes.  If Arabs and Muslims were to be the villains, the directors could have taken this opportunity to show how they are also humans, and there are reasons that they turn to a life of violence.  If you see this movie, consider as you watch it if every single Arab or Muslim in the movie was replaced by a Jew.  It's not so far-fetched.  Movies of the 30s commonly had the stereotypical Jew in the role that Arabs and Muslims now fill all too often today.  But we now realize portraying most minorities as stereotypes and over-the-top villains is wrong.  Thank God we now know this is anti-Semitic, and have rejected such racist portrayals.  Except Arabs are Semites too.  This movie had the directing, acting, and writing to have a lot of potential.  As it is, it will show all over the US and confirm American prejudices of Arabs and Muslims.  Then it will show all over the world, and confirm Arab and Muslim beliefs of what we think of them.  And that won't go very far in obtaining peace.

review/summary: Memo to Hollywood: The Situation in Afghanistan is No Joke!
review/text: I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon!  It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have always got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, one of the Merchant's of Death literally has a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)!  Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!  I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!

review/summary: A Very Pleasant Surprise
review/text: Seeing this on the heels of watching the new James Bond Quantum of Solace and the re-make of the Day The Earth Stood Still (two huge disappointments) Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise. The film had plot, acting, dialogue, direction, special effects, humor - what a concept, maybe this type of film making could catch on in Hollywood. What do you think? I'm already anxious for the sequel. Weak spots - not too many, perhaps Jeff Bridges characters motivation. But that's nit picking.

review/summary: Even In Our Super Hero Glut, This is a Great Movie
review/text: Now that all of our summer blockbusters have become nothing but comic book super heroes, some of them still deliver a great time.  IRON MAN is one of them.  I used to get Iron Man comics as a kid but he wasn't as popular and iconic as Superman or Batman.  In fact, I can't remember any of the villains from his comics, but he had a cool suit and the artwork was as topnotch as the best of Marvel during the 70s.  The film version definitely has as much to offer as the best of the super hero movie.  The script is tight, the characters are fleshed out, the humor is funny and genuine, the special effects and production values are topnotch.  Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot to the role of Tony Stark and you almost believe the role was written just for him.  IRON MAN leaves you wanting more.  And since it made a gigantic pile of money, I'm sure we'll be seeing more of him.  Be sure to stick around for a short scene following the end credits (this past summer's THE INCREDIBLE HULK also featured a post-credits scene of Tony Stark popping up as well!).  And, was it just me, or did everyone think that was Kris Kristofferson every time Jeff Bridges showed up?

review/text: Everyone knows it. It's no secret. Iron Man filled our superhero needs. Being that he is one of the rare international heroes who fights in more places than just NEW YORK makes him a little more noble than the others. Tony Stark is easily one of the coolest characters with and without the suit, considering his fast remarks and big attitude. It's a must see, must have, hands down.

review/summary: A cool exec with a heart of steel?
review/text: Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with "Michael Keaton as Batman" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur "Happy" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!) All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined.

review/summary: Workaround for Blu-Ray Play Problems
review/text: I love the movie. I've seen it many times and was excited about getting the Blu-Ray disc. Unfortunately, I went through two of the discs because they would not play. It turns out the problem has nothing to do with the disc, but with the BDLive content. If you have your Blu-Ray player connected to the Internet, you will likely have problems playing your disc.  To get the disc to play, go into your player's SETUP and change the NETWORK permissions for BDLive to either CONFIRM or PROHIBIT. Then try to play your disc again. You should no longer have any problem.  I have not found any information on why this is happening, but it's nice to know that I can watch the movie. This is one of the BEST superhero movies to date and rates up there with The Dark Knight.

review/summary: Among Best Comic-Book Movies EVER!
review/text: One of the best comic-book movies ever! That comes from a big-time comic-book and comic-book movie fan. Everything felt right. Robert Downey JR was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. Jeff Bridges still plays a bad guy as well as anybody onscreen. Gweneth Paltrow IS Pepper Potts in look and characterization. Marvel hit one out of the ballpark with this movie.  The story updates the characters for a more modern look and feel. Instead of Vietnam we are in the middle east. Yet, the update is so true to who the characters are that they never lose track of how things should be. The first Iron-Man armor is crudely built to escape from the bad guys. Tony Stark's motivation for being Iron-Man is stronger than his comic book's version. Here he is fighting to undo the bad (Stark's company selling weapons for war usage) by becoming Iron-Man.  Once back home Tony goes through a few Iron Man armors which fits in perfectly with his comic book history. I don't say this with a grain of salt, this is one of the best comic book movies ever! It stays very true to the comics but also adds to the characters. We almost know what's coming but the movie still surprises. It's one of the rare comic book movies that holds up in repeat viewings. I'd put this up with the first two Spidey movies. first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's and the current Batman movies & X-Men 2. This movie is so good (and I was skeptical going in because I always liked Iron Man) that I wonder how they will top it in the sequel. It's going to be fun finding out.  I don't even recommend renting this movie. BUY IT! Nuff said.

review/summary: Marvel Comic with Pizzazz (From Blu-Ray Version)
review/text: Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.  Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.  Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while "inside" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.  The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of not
